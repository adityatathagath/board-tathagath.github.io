Czech Republic Elections 2025: Comprehensive Market Risk Analysis
The Czech Republic is heading into pivotal parliamentary elections on October 3-4, 2025, with significant implications for both domestic economic policy and the country’s position within the European Union. Based on current polling data and political dynamics, the opposition ANO party led by Andrej Babiš appears likely to return to power, presenting material risks for financial markets and economic policy direction.
Election Overview and Key Dynamics
The Czech parliamentary elections will determine the composition of all 200 members of the Chamber of Deputies. Current polling consistently shows ANO 2011 leading with approximately 31.2% of voter support, while the governing SPOLU coalition trails at 19.8%[wikipedia +2]. This represents a significant shift from the 2021 elections when SPOLU narrowly defeated ANO.
The election takes place against a backdrop of economic challenges, with Czech households facing some of the highest electricity prices in the EU and food costs exceeding regional averages[expats]. Public dissatisfaction with the current government’s economic performance, despite relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals, has created favorable conditions for the populist opposition.
For the first time in Czech parliamentary elections, citizens living abroad can vote by mail[expats], potentially affecting approximately 1.2 million Czech expatriates worldwide. This procedural change adds an element of uncertainty to turnout calculations and could influence the final outcome.
Political Landscape and Coalition Scenarios
Most Likely Scenario: ANO-Led Coalition Government (60-70% probability)
Current polling suggests ANO will secure approximately 68 seats but fall short of an absolute majority, necessitating coalition partners[praguedaily]. The most probable configuration involves ANO forming a government with Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) and potentially the Motorists for Themselves party, creating a populist coalition with Eurosceptic tendencies.
This scenario presents several concerning developments for European integration and economic policy:

Alternative Scenario: Current Government Retention (20-30% probability)
The SPOLU coalition, led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, would need a significant late-campaign surge to retain power. This outcome would likely maintain:


Deadlock Scenario: Hung Parliament (10-20% probability)
A fragmented parliament with no clear majority could result in extended coalition negotiations, creating temporary policy paralysis and market uncertainty.
Economic Context and Pre-Election Conditions
The Czech economy presents a mixed picture heading into the election. GDP growth resumed at 1.1% in 2024 and is forecast to accelerate to 1.9% in 2025[economy-finance.europa]. However, this modest recovery masks underlying structural challenges:


Inflation and Monetary Policy
The Czech National Bank has successfully brought inflation down to 2.5% in August 2025, within the target range of 2% ± 1%[tradingeconomics +1]. This achievement has enabled the CNB to cut interest rates from pandemic highs, with the key rate currently at 3.5%[tradingeconomics]. However, underlying service sector inflation remains elevated, limiting the scope for aggressive monetary easing.
Fiscal Position
Czech public finances remain relatively healthy compared to EU peers, with public debt projected at 44.5% of GDP in 2025[economy-finance.europa]. However, this represents a significant increase from 30% in 2019, reflecting pandemic-related spending. The government has pursued fiscal consolidation, but election promises from opposition parties threaten to derail this trajectory.
External Vulnerabilities
The Czech economy’s heavy dependence on external demand, particularly from Germany (33% of exports), creates significant vulnerability[scoperatings]. The ongoing transition in the automotive sector, which represents 25% of exports, poses additional challenges as the industry shifts toward electric vehicles.

Scenario 3: Hung Parliament
Market Impact:

European Union and Geopolitical Implications
An ANO victory would significantly alter the Czech Republic’s role within European institutions. Babiš has explicitly aligned with the “Patriots for Europe” group in the European Parliament, alongside parties from Hungary, Slovakia, and France[freiheit]. This alignment suggests potential coordination with Viktor Orbán’s government on EU policies.
Key EU Policy Areas at Risk:

The prospect of a Czech-Hungarian-Slovak axis within the EU could significantly complicate European integration efforts, particularly as the bloc faces challenges from potential changes in U.S. policy under a second Trump presidency.
Investment and Trading Implications
Currency Strategy
The Czech koruna faces substantial headwinds regardless of election outcome, with technical analysis suggesting potential test of 26.00 EUR/CZK in an ANO victory scenario[expats]. Macro market risk teams should consider:


Fixed Income Positioning
Czech government bonds present asymmetric risk profiles with limited upside potential but significant downside risk in adverse electoral scenarios. Key considerations include:

Equity Market Assessment
Czech equity markets face headwinds from both domestic policy uncertainty and external economic pressures. Manufacturing sector exposure to German demand and automotive industry transformation creates additional layers of risk beyond political factors.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The Czech elections represent a critical inflection point for both domestic economic policy and the country’s European integration trajectory. With ANO maintaining a substantial polling lead, markets should prepare for a period of heightened volatility and potential fundamental shifts in policy direction.
For macro market risk assessment, key monitoring points include:

The confluence of domestic political change, regional geopolitical tensions, and ongoing economic transformation challenges creates a complex risk environment requiring careful monitoring and dynamic hedging strategies. Market participants should prepare for potentially sustained periods of elevated volatility as these political and economic dynamics unfold.
