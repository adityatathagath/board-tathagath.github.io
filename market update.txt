🌍 Global Macro Snapshot (as of August 6, 2025)

🇺🇸 United States
	•	IMF Global Growth (2025): Raised to 3.0%, with 3.1% forecast for 2026; U.S. growth revised upward, but fiscal and tariff risks remain  ￼.
	•	Trade Disruption: Average U.S. tariff rate fell from 24% to ~17% via limited deals (with EU, Japan, China), yet Trump escalated duties on dozens of countries (~10–50%), pushing effective rates globally to ~18%  ￼.
	•	Risk to Earnings: Corporate earnings across industrial & consumer goods sectors are seeing a $15 b hit, with Caterpillar, Molson Coors, and others reporting elevated input costs (e.g. aluminum charges)  ￼.

🌐 Asia-Pacific & Emerging Markets
	•	India–U.S. Trade Fallout:
	•	A 25% tariff on Indian exports took effect August 1, impacting textiles, auto parts, electronics and more; India faces further “very substantial” hikes due to Russian oil imports  ￼.
	•	U.S. effective tariff rate on Indian exports now at ~20.7%, up markedly from 2.4% a year ago; this may shave ~0.2–0.3pp off India’s 2025 growth (~6.2–6.4%)  ￼.
	•	Market reaction: equity & rupee weakness, negative sentiment into supply chain strategies, though India remains relevant for China‑plus‑one sourcing  ￼.
	•	Thailand–Cambodia Conflict:
	•	Border clashes have killed ~38–43 civilians & soldiers, displaced ~200,000+ people, and inflicted at least ฿10 b (~US $307m) in damage. The Thai government approved a ฿25 b (~US $770m) relief fund for province rebuild, soft loans, and tax relief  ￼ ￼.
	•	ASEAN-brokered ceasefire holds, though spillover and diplomatic strain remain major risk factors  ￼.

🇪🇺 Europe & United Kingdom
	•	Trade Pact Relief: U.S.–EU agreement capped EU export tariffs at 15%, softening earlier threats; euro fell ~1.3% as trade uncertainty eased  ￼.
	•	Growth Outlook: IMF projects UK growth at ~1.2% for 2025; eurozone economic resilience remains dependent on export demand and central bank posture  ￼.


🇮🇳 India – U.S. Tariff Escalation & Strategic Pushback

🔥 Trade Escalation Snapshot:
	•	25% blanket tariff on Indian goods took effect August 1, targeting categories like smartphones, auto parts, apparel, and jewelry. U.S. consumers may face up to 17% price hikes on clothing and higher costs for auto repairs and pharmaceuticals.
￼ ￼
	•	U.S. effective tariff rate on Indian exports has surged to 20.7%, a sharp jump from just 2.4% in 2024, according to a Fitch report.
￼

⚠️ Trump’s New Threats:
	•	On August 5–6, President Trump warned he may raise tariffs “very substantially”—possibly beyond 25%—within 24 hours over India’s continued imports of Russian oil.
￼
	•	India has formally rebuked the U.S. and EU, accusing them of double standards in Russian trade, citing their own energy dealings with Russia while penalizing India.
￼

🏛️ How Trade Talks Unraveled:
	•	Negotiations collapsed despite earlier optimism after PM Modi’s February U.S. visit, where a goal to reach $500B bilateral trade by 2030 was established. Talks stalled over tariff equity on farm and industrial goods.
￼
	•	India’s public internal estimate suggests a 25% tariff could affect ~10% of its exports, lowering GDP growth by ~0.3ppt, per HSBC’s chief India economist.
￼

🌐 Strategic Implications:
	•	The elevated tariff environment may erase India’s competitive edge in the “China‑plus‑one” strategy, despite its large domestic market and supply chain diversification pull.
￼
	•	India is preparing a ₹20,000 crore (~US$2.5 b) trade support and branding initiative to support exporters, including push for stronger “Brand India” recognition.

	•	Trade Tensions Escalate: President Trump signed an executive order imposing new tariffs (10–50%) on 66 countries—including 25% on India, 39% on Switzerland—set to take effect on August 7. Markets reacted negatively, sparking inflation worries and a market sell-off.  ￼
