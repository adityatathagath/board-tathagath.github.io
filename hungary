1) TL;DR (as of 11 Aug 2025, IST)
	•	Growth is weak, disinflation is bumpy, policy is tight. Gov’t cut 2025 growth to ~1%; EC sees 0.8%; IMF 1.4%. Inflation ~4.3% y/y in July; MNB has kept base rate 6.50% for 10 straight meetings and just cut the reserve-requirement to 8% from 10% (from 1 Aug).  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Fiscal is under EU corrective oversight. Hungary is in an Excessive Deficit Procedure with a net-expenditure growth cap (4.3% in 2025; 4.0% in 2026) to bring deficit under 3% by 2026.  ￼
	•	Rule-of-law standoff still binds funding. Around €19bn in EU funds remain suspended (over €1bn now permanently lost), and Budapest is using leverage on the next EU budget to get more unlocked.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Politics is the big wild card into the 2026 election. New opposition party TISZA surged in 2024 EP elections and leads polls into 2026; Brussels remains critical on democratic standards.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Market snapshot. EUR/HUF 395.88 (ECB ref, 8 Aug). 10y HGB yield ~7.1% (Eurostat/TE, Jun). S&P BBB-/Neg, Fitch BBB/Stable, Moody’s Baa2/Neg.  ￼ ￼  ￼ ￼ ￼

2) Political landscape (what you need to know)

System & players. Hungary is a parliamentary republic. PM Viktor Orbán (Fidesz) has ruled since 2010, using consecutive two-thirds majorities at times to reshape institutions (2011 Fundamental Law; media framework). Critics say checks-and-balances weakened; EU rule-of-law processes followed.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Recent pivots.
	•	2024: President Katalin Novák resigned after a pardon scandal; parliament elected Tamás Sulyok president. Hungary ratified Sweden’s NATO accession.  ￼
	•	2024 EP & locals: New opposition TISZA (Péter Magyar) shocked with 7 of 21 EP seats; Fidesz fell to ~44–45%. TISZA later joined the EPP group; polls in 2025 show it leading Fidesz. Parliamentary election due 2026.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	2025: EU’s 2025 Rule of Law Report remained critical; tensions over frozen funds persisted. Orbán is leveraging veto power over the next EU budget to press for disbursements.  ￼ ￼

Why markets care: a credible chance of political turnover in 2026 plus ongoing EU funds conditionality = path-dependent fiscal/FX/rates scenarios. Rhetoric (EU budget, Ukraine, migration, LGBTQ laws) can spill into funding, risk premia, and forint.

3) Macro: where things stand

Growth. The recovery is shallow. After flat/negative prints in late-2024/early-2025, the gov’t cut 2025 growth to 1%; EC 0.8%; IMF 1.4%. External headwinds (German softness; global tariffs) weigh.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Inflation. CPI 4.3% y/y in July, down from 4.6% in June; disinflation is uneven and core pressures linger per IMF. MNB targets 3% ±1pp and keeps stance tight.  ￼ ￼

Monetary policy. MNB base rate 6.50% (unchanged since Sep-2024). On 22 Jul, MNB cut banks’ reserve ratio to 8% (from 10%) effective 1 Aug, framing it as neutral to stance.  ￼

External balance. Current account swung to surplus in 2024 (≈2.2% of GDP); IMF expects about 1¼% in 2025 as demand recovers. Reserves high relative to short-term debt.  ￼ ￼

Fiscal. Under EDP: Council set a net-expenditure path (4.3% ’25; 4.0% ’26) to correct the excessive deficit by 2026. Market focus: budget execution vs. caps and election-driven slippage risk.  ￼

EU funds. Around €19bn remains suspended; over €1bn is permanently lost. This channels into capex/FI flows and can move spreads/FX when headlines hit.  ￼ ￼

4) Markets & exposures (how it maps to trades)

FX (HUF).
	•	Level: EUR/HUF 395.88 (ECB fix, 8 Aug). HUF is highly headline-sensitive to rule-of-law/EU funds and MNB signals.  ￼
	•	Drivers: (i) MNB vs. inflation path; (ii) EU funds disbursement risk; (iii) tariffs/German cycle; (iv) 2026 election probability tree.  ￼ ￼

Rates (HGBs).
	•	Long end: 10y ~7.1% (Eurostat/TE, Jun). Spreads hinge on budget execution, EU funds, and MNB staying restrictive.  ￼
	•	Supply: AKK met ~prorated H1 plan and lifted 2025 FX issuance to manage higher needs (liquidity buffer).  ￼ ￼

Credit.
	•	Sovereign ratings: S&P BBB-/Neg (Apr-2025), Fitch BBB/Stable (Jun-2025), Moody’s Baa2/Neg (May-2025); outlooks hinge on fiscal/EU funds.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Real-economy FDI headlines that can swing assets.
	•	EV/batteries: BYD reportedly delayed Hungarian plant mass-production to 2026; CATL Debrecen phase-2 signals mixed; German OEMs reaffirmed Hungary footprint late-2024.  ￼ ￼
	•	Energy: Paks II nuclear expansion gained regulatory green light to resume broader construction (Jun) and benefitted from a U.S. sanctions exemption in late Jun.  ￼ ￼

⸻

5) What to watch (playbook for the next 12 months)

High-impact catalysts
	1.	EU funds: any formal unfreezing/additional suspension or new conditions (moves HUF/spreads quickly).  ￼
	2.	Budget execution vs. EDP path (monthly cash data; mid-year revisions).  ￼
	3.	MNB: tone on inflation risks; any corridor tweaks or surprise easing later in 2025. Meetings monthly; 2025 Inflation Reports (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec).  ￼
	4.	Trade policy & Germany: spillovers from tariffs and German softness to CEE.  ￼
	5.	Election dynamics: TISZA polling, policy platforms (tax, EU stance).  ￼

Recurring data/events to calendar
	•	CPI (KSH): around the 8th–11th each month; July print 4.3%.  ￼
	•	MNB Monetary Council releases + minutes cadence (minutes ~3 weeks after).  ￼
	•	External: MNB current account/BOP monthly & quarterly.  ￼

⸻

6) Risk scenarios (for stress testing & positioning thought-starters)

Base case (next 6–12m).
	•	Growth ~1% (±0.5pp). CPI trends to 4–4½% into Q4; MNB on hold through 2025; modest current-account surplus persists. EU funds remain partly frozen but no cliff. Implications: range-trading HUF (roughly high-380s/low-400s vs EUR if global risk benign), 7–7.5% 10y yields, ratings unchanged.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Bull (EU détente & soft landing).
	•	Brussels unlocks a chunk of funds; German outlook stabilizes; MNB signals gradual 2026 easing path. Implications: HUF firming (mid- to high-380s), tighter HGB spreads, better bank/credit tone.  ￼ ￼

Bear 1 (policy slippage / pre-election spend).
	•	Budget misses EDP path; ratings outlooks worsen; EU threatens deeper suspensions. Implications: HUF >405–415 vs EUR, 10y >7.8–8.2%, CDS wider; risk of S&P downgrade watch.  ￼ ￼

Bear 2 (political shock).
	•	Escalating EU confrontation (e.g., over LGBTQ/rule-of-law legislation) or snap-election talk. Implications: volatility cluster; HUF selloff, curve steepening.  ￼

Bear 3 (global tariffs → CEE hit).
	•	New/expanded tariffs cut into CEE exports; S&P warns on spillovers. Implications: growth undershoot, pressure on FX/rates.  ￼

⸻

7) How to think about desk positioning (generic guide)

FX (EUR/HUF).
	•	Base: stay nimble; headline-hedge with cheap optionality around EU-funds dates/MNB minutes.
	•	Bull-EU-funds: bias to fade spikes and/or long HUF on confirmed disbursement steps.
	•	Bear-fiscal/politics: long EUR/HUF or buy topside; consider cross-hedges via PLN/HUF if regional shock.

Rates.
	•	Base: carry in the belly with tight risk limits; watch AKK supply windows.
	•	Bull: add duration on credible funds unlock + benign inflation.
	•	Bear: reduce DV01; prefer steeper expressions (bear-steepeners) as fiscal risk rises.

Credit.
	•	Maintain awareness of outlook-driven gap risk (S&P Neg; Moody’s Neg). Favor high-quality financials with strong capital, but watch for sovereign-ceiling effects.  ￼ ￼

(You’ll calibrate sizes to your book; above is the decision framework.)

9) Quick data annex (handy facts)
	•	Policy rate: 6.50%; reserve-req. 8% from 1 Aug 2025.  ￼
	•	CPI: 4.3% y/y (Jul).  ￼
	•	EUR/HUF: 395.88 (ECB ref, 8 Aug).  ￼
	•	10y HGB: ~7.1% (Eurostat/TE, Jun print).  ￼
	•	Current account: surplus 2.2%/GDP (2024); IMF sees ~1¼% in 2025.  ￼ ￼
	•	Ratings: BBB-/Neg (S&P); BBB/Stable (Fitch); Baa2/Neg (Moody’s).  ￼ ￼ ￼




Current snapshot (Aug 2025)
	•	Who runs the show: Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz–KDNP alliance (in power since 2010; earlier 1998–2002). The presidency is largely ceremonial; Tamás Sulyok became president on Feb 26, 2024 after Katalin Novák resigned amid a pardon scandal.  ￼ ￼
	•	Opposition dynamic: A new force, Péter Magyar’s TISZA, has consolidated much of the fragmented opposition. In the June 9, 2024 European Parliament vote, Fidesz won ~44.5% (11 seats) and TISZA ~29.7% (7 seats)—the strongest non-Fidesz showing in years. Polling since then shows TISZA competitive ahead of 2026 elections.  ￼ ￼
	•	EU friction (market-salient): Ongoing rule-of-law dispute keeps sizable EU funds under conditionality; in July 2025 the Commission even floated tighter budget-linked conditionality for member states that backslide. This remains a central lever over Budapest.  ￼ ￼
	•	Geopolitical posture: Budapest is NATO/EU but runs an outlier line on Ukraine/Russia; expects transactional ties with Moscow and frequently clashes with EU consensus. (Parliament did ultimately ratify Sweden’s NATO entry on Feb 26, 2024.)  ￼ ￼
	•	Civic space & media: Multiple monitors describe a hybrid/illiberal system with state-aligned media dominance and constraints on NGOs/LGBTQ rights. This is a key reason for EU conditionality and ongoing protests.  ￼

What changed in 2024–2025 (why EM desks care)
	•	New competitive opposition: TISZA’s rapid rise means real electoral risk to Fidesz in 2026, a first since 2010. Street mobilization and media protests have kept pressure on state media. Expect elevated headline risk and policy noise into 2026.  ￼ ￼
	•	EU funds as leverage: Brussels is exploring broader suspension tools in the next EU budget—any movement (unlock or escalation) can shift spreads, HUF, and risk premia.  ￼
	•	Campaign framing: Orbán is leaning into anti-Ukraine/EU narratives to shore up the base—expect rhetorical spikes and Brussels clashes as polling tightens.  ￼

How we got here — short timeline since 1989
	•	1990s pluralism: MDF, then socialist-liberal coalitions set the early democratic order. (Parliamentary republic; PM is head of government; president is ceremonial.)  ￼
	•	1998–2002: First Orbán term.
	•	2002–2010: Socialist-led governments (notably 2006 “Őszöd” speech scandal and protests) weakened the left.
	•	2010–present: Fidesz wins a two-thirds “constitutional” majority, enabling one-party constitutional rewiring: new Fundamental Law (2011), media laws, and subsequent amendments that critics say reduced checks and balances and tilted the electoral field. These steps underpin today’s illiberal equilibrium.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	2015–2018: Migration crisis politics and further centralization; rising EU tensions over rule of law, NGOs, academia, and media.  ￼
	•	2022: Fidesz wins again (comfortable majority).  ￼
	•	2024: Novák resigns → Sulyok president (Feb 26); Budapest & EP elections (Jun 9) show Fidesz wounded, TISZA surging; Sweden’s NATO ratified after long delay.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	2025: Rule-of-law standoff intensifies via budget-linked conditionality proposals; opposition continues mobilizing via protests and media campaigns.  ￼ ￼

Risk takeaways for positioning
	•	Election path (2026): Base case is Fidesz incumbent advantage (state resources, media ecosystem), but tail risk of regime change is much higher than any time since 2010. Watch poll-of-polls trend and coalition math.  ￼
	•	EU funds binary: Any positive step (partial unfreeze / clearer roadmap) is bullish HGB & HUF; an escalation (wider conditionality or Article-7-style dynamics) is bearish, with ratings rhetoric re-engaging.  ￼
	•	Geopolitical shocks: Rhetoric on Ukraine/Russia can trigger EU/NATO frictions and headline risk—more noise into election season.  ￼

EU funds & politics (market-relevant)
	•	~€18bn EU funds still frozen (cohesion + RRF); Commission signalling tighter conditionality in July.  ￼
	•	Politicals (2026 election): New TISZA party leads Fidesz in multiple polls; campaign heating up. Orban linking EU budget support to fund release.  ￼
	•	Fresh friction: EU capitals urge rethink of Pride-law seen as restricting LGBTQ+ events—adds to rule-of-law overhang.  ￼

Industry & idiosyncratic
	•	EV/FDI: BYD delays mass production at Szeged to 2026; will run below capacity initially. CATL Debrecen phase-2 preparation reported paused by local press.  ￼ ￼

⸻

What it means for positioning
	•	FX (HUF): Bias softer if growth sticks near ~1% and policy remains on hold while EU funds stay frozen; 400–405 looks pivotal unless there’s a positive funds surprise. (View informed by Reuters FX poll and EC/IMF growth paths.)  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Rates (HGB): Long end sensitive to supply and EDP compliance; bull-steepen on EU-funds progress + cooler prints; bear-steepen on fiscal slippage or tariff shocks. (Use ÁKK updates & Council EDP as triggers.)  ￼ ￼
	•	Credit: Ratings skew still to the downside (S&P Neg; Moody’s Neg); CDS likely reactive to EU-funds and EV-trade headlines.  ￼ ￼

⸻

Quick scenario grid (next 1–3 months; indicative)
	•	Bull (25%): EU indicates partial unfreeze / clearer roadmap; CPI drifts toward ~4.0%; MNB steady. EUR/HUF 385–395; 10Y 6.5–6.8%. (Catalyst: Commission update; strong auction covers.)  ￼
	•	Base (50%): Growth ~1%, CPI ~4¼–4¾%; EDP grinding compliance; funding plan proceeds. EUR/HUF 395–405; 10Y 6.8–7.2%.  ￼ ￼
	•	Bear (25%): Trade-shock or EU-funds stalemate → rating rhetoric picks up; FDI headlines wobble. EUR/HUF 410–420; 10Y 7.5–8.0%.  ￼
