1) TL;DR (as of 11 Aug 2025, IST)
	•	Growth is weak, disinflation is bumpy, policy is tight. Gov’t cut 2025 growth to ~1%; EC sees 0.8%; IMF 1.4%. Inflation ~4.3% y/y in July; MNB has kept base rate 6.50% for 10 straight meetings and just cut the reserve-requirement to 8% from 10% (from 1 Aug).  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Fiscal is under EU corrective oversight. Hungary is in an Excessive Deficit Procedure with a net-expenditure growth cap (4.3% in 2025; 4.0% in 2026) to bring deficit under 3% by 2026.  ￼
	•	Rule-of-law standoff still binds funding. Around €19bn in EU funds remain suspended (over €1bn now permanently lost), and Budapest is using leverage on the next EU budget to get more unlocked.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Politics is the big wild card into the 2026 election. New opposition party TISZA surged in 2024 EP elections and leads polls into 2026; Brussels remains critical on democratic standards.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Market snapshot. EUR/HUF 395.88 (ECB ref, 8 Aug). 10y HGB yield ~7.1% (Eurostat/TE, Jun). S&P BBB-/Neg, Fitch BBB/Stable, Moody’s Baa2/Neg.  ￼ ￼  ￼ ￼ ￼

2) Political landscape (what you need to know)

System & players. Hungary is a parliamentary republic. PM Viktor Orbán (Fidesz) has ruled since 2010, using consecutive two-thirds majorities at times to reshape institutions (2011 Fundamental Law; media framework). Critics say checks-and-balances weakened; EU rule-of-law processes followed.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Recent pivots.
	•	2024: President Katalin Novák resigned after a pardon scandal; parliament elected Tamás Sulyok president. Hungary ratified Sweden’s NATO accession.  ￼
	•	2024 EP & locals: New opposition TISZA (Péter Magyar) shocked with 7 of 21 EP seats; Fidesz fell to ~44–45%. TISZA later joined the EPP group; polls in 2025 show it leading Fidesz. Parliamentary election due 2026.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	2025: EU’s 2025 Rule of Law Report remained critical; tensions over frozen funds persisted. Orbán is leveraging veto power over the next EU budget to press for disbursements.  ￼ ￼

Why markets care: a credible chance of political turnover in 2026 plus ongoing EU funds conditionality = path-dependent fiscal/FX/rates scenarios. Rhetoric (EU budget, Ukraine, migration, LGBTQ laws) can spill into funding, risk premia, and forint.

3) Macro: where things stand

Growth. The recovery is shallow. After flat/negative prints in late-2024/early-2025, the gov’t cut 2025 growth to 1%; EC 0.8%; IMF 1.4%. External headwinds (German softness; global tariffs) weigh.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Inflation. CPI 4.3% y/y in July, down from 4.6% in June; disinflation is uneven and core pressures linger per IMF. MNB targets 3% ±1pp and keeps stance tight.  ￼ ￼

Monetary policy. MNB base rate 6.50% (unchanged since Sep-2024). On 22 Jul, MNB cut banks’ reserve ratio to 8% (from 10%) effective 1 Aug, framing it as neutral to stance.  ￼

External balance. Current account swung to surplus in 2024 (≈2.2% of GDP); IMF expects about 1¼% in 2025 as demand recovers. Reserves high relative to short-term debt.  ￼ ￼

Fiscal. Under EDP: Council set a net-expenditure path (4.3% ’25; 4.0% ’26) to correct the excessive deficit by 2026. Market focus: budget execution vs. caps and election-driven slippage risk.  ￼

EU funds. Around €19bn remains suspended; over €1bn is permanently lost. This channels into capex/FI flows and can move spreads/FX when headlines hit.  ￼ ￼

4) Markets & exposures (how it maps to trades)

FX (HUF).
	•	Level: EUR/HUF 395.88 (ECB fix, 8 Aug). HUF is highly headline-sensitive to rule-of-law/EU funds and MNB signals.  ￼
	•	Drivers: (i) MNB vs. inflation path; (ii) EU funds disbursement risk; (iii) tariffs/German cycle; (iv) 2026 election probability tree.  ￼ ￼

Rates (HGBs).
	•	Long end: 10y ~7.1% (Eurostat/TE, Jun). Spreads hinge on budget execution, EU funds, and MNB staying restrictive.  ￼
	•	Supply: AKK met ~prorated H1 plan and lifted 2025 FX issuance to manage higher needs (liquidity buffer).  ￼ ￼

Credit.
	•	Sovereign ratings: S&P BBB-/Neg (Apr-2025), Fitch BBB/Stable (Jun-2025), Moody’s Baa2/Neg (May-2025); outlooks hinge on fiscal/EU funds.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Real-economy FDI headlines that can swing assets.
	•	EV/batteries: BYD reportedly delayed Hungarian plant mass-production to 2026; CATL Debrecen phase-2 signals mixed; German OEMs reaffirmed Hungary footprint late-2024.  ￼ ￼
	•	Energy: Paks II nuclear expansion gained regulatory green light to resume broader construction (Jun) and benefitted from a U.S. sanctions exemption in late Jun.  ￼ ￼

5) What to watch (playbook for the next 12 months)

High-impact catalysts
	1.	EU funds: any formal unfreezing/additional suspension or new conditions (moves HUF/spreads quickly).  ￼
	2.	Budget execution vs. EDP path (monthly cash data; mid-year revisions).  ￼
	3.	MNB: tone on inflation risks; any corridor tweaks or surprise easing later in 2025. Meetings monthly; 2025 Inflation Reports (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec).  ￼
	4.	Trade policy & Germany: spillovers from tariffs and German softness to CEE.  ￼
	5.	Election dynamics: TISZA polling, policy platforms (tax, EU stance).  ￼

Recurring data/events to calendar
	•	CPI (KSH): around the 8th–11th each month; July print 4.3%.  ￼
	•	MNB Monetary Council releases + minutes cadence (minutes ~3 weeks after).  ￼
	•	External: MNB current account/BOP monthly & quarterly.  ￼

6) Risk scenarios (for stress testing & positioning thought-starters)

Base case (next 6–12m).
	•	Growth ~1% (±0.5pp). CPI trends to 4–4½% into Q4; MNB on hold through 2025; modest current-account surplus persists. EU funds remain partly frozen but no cliff. Implications: range-trading HUF (roughly high-380s/low-400s vs EUR if global risk benign), 7–7.5% 10y yields, ratings unchanged.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Bull (EU détente & soft landing).
	•	Brussels unlocks a chunk of funds; German outlook stabilizes; MNB signals gradual 2026 easing path. Implications: HUF firming (mid- to high-380s), tighter HGB spreads, better bank/credit tone.  ￼ ￼

Bear 1 (policy slippage / pre-election spend).
	•	Budget misses EDP path; ratings outlooks worsen; EU threatens deeper suspensions. Implications: HUF >405–415 vs EUR, 10y >7.8–8.2%, CDS wider; risk of S&P downgrade watch.  ￼ ￼

Bear 2 (political shock).
	•	Escalating EU confrontation (e.g., over LGBTQ/rule-of-law legislation) or snap-election talk. Implications: volatility cluster; HUF selloff, curve steepening.  ￼

Bear 3 (global tariffs → CEE hit).
	•	New/expanded tariffs cut into CEE exports; S&P warns on spillovers. Implications: growth undershoot, pressure on FX/rates.  ￼

7) How to think about desk positioning (generic guide)

FX (EUR/HUF).
	•	Base: stay nimble; headline-hedge with cheap optionality around EU-funds dates/MNB minutes.
	•	Bull-EU-funds: bias to fade spikes and/or long HUF on confirmed disbursement steps.
	•	Bear-fiscal/politics: long EUR/HUF or buy topside; consider cross-hedges via PLN/HUF if regional shock.

Rates.
	•	Base: carry in the belly with tight risk limits; watch AKK supply windows.
	•	Bull: add duration on credible funds unlock + benign inflation.
	•	Bear: reduce DV01; prefer steeper expressions (bear-steepeners) as fiscal risk rises.

Credit.
	•	Maintain awareness of outlook-driven gap risk (S&P Neg; Moody’s Neg). Favor high-quality financials with strong capital, but watch for sovereign-ceiling effects.  ￼ ￼
