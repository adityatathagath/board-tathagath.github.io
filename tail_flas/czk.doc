Spolu Regains Power (Unexpected Outcome)
Rationale:
Despite polls favoring ANO, an unexpected electoral outcome gives the centre-right Spolu coalition a surprise victory. Markets welcome the return of a moderate, fiscally disciplined government closely aligned with the EU.
Expected Reaction:
Likely rally as political uncertainty fades and market confidence improves. CZK bonds and currency strengthen, yields may tighten modestly, reflecting reduced risk of populist policies.

Scenario	Rationale Summary	Rally or Selloff
ANO + Centre-Right	Fiscal discipline, moderate policy, stable EU ties	Rally / Stability
