1. ANO Forms Coalition with Centre-Right (SPOLU/STAN)
Rationale:
This scenario keeps power balanced, markets see ANO tempered by moderate parties. Investors trust fiscal discipline, moderate policy shifts, and stable EU alignment.
Expected Reaction:
Likely rally or stability in CZK bonds and swaps. Yields could fall modestly as political uncertainty resolves. CZK currency may strengthen on investor confidence.
2. ANO Forms Coalition with Far-Right/Far-Left (SPD, Stačilo)
Rationale:
Markets fear populist fiscal expansion (higher spending, lower institutional checks) and weaker EU/Ukraine alignment. Concerns over inflation and debt sustainability rise sharply.
Expected Reaction:
Significant selloff in CZK bonds and swaps. Investors will demand higher yields (spreads widen) and CZK likely weakens. The yield could rise to 5.2% or more for 10-year bonds.
3. President Tries to Block Babis as PM
Rationale:
Political standoff elevates uncertainty. Markets watch for constitutional crisis, delays in government formation, and risk premium goes up. However, outcome depends on length and perception of legal stability.
Expected Reaction:
Initial moderate selloff as investors hedge political risk. If resolved quickly, markets rebound. Prolonged crisis means persistent volatility and spread widening; short-lived impasse could see quick reversal.
4. Delays in Post-Election Coalition Formation (Hung Parliament)
Rationale:
Unclear government leads to uncertainty about fiscal and reform trajectory. Historical crises saw selling pressure on bonds, but levels depend on time and participants.
Expected Reaction:
Moderate selloff in bonds and swaps due to uncertainty. CZK weakens moderately, but not as much as with a clearly radical coalition. Yields could rise 60-100 basis points temporarily.
________________________________________
Scenario	Rationale Summary	Rally or Selloff
ANO + Centre-Right	Fiscal discipline, moderate policy, stable EU ties	Rally/Stability
ANO + Far-Right/Far-Left	Populist spending, riskier policies, inflation fears	Selloff
Presidential Block/Constitutional Crisis	Legal/political standoff; temp. risk premium	Selloff / rebound
Coalition Delay (Hung Parliament)	Uncertainty, unclear reforms, short-term selling	Moderate Selloff
Every scenario is differentiated—only the more moderate coalition leads to stable/rallying markets. Severe or prolonged uncertainty, or highly populist coalitions, provoke clear selloffs.
