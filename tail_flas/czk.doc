Spolu Regains Power (Unexpected Outcome)
Rationale:
Despite polls favoring ANO, an unexpected electoral outcome gives the centre-right Spolu coalition a surprise victory. Markets welcome the return of a moderate, fiscally disciplined government closely aligned with the EU.
Expected Reaction:
Likely rally as political uncertainty fades and market confidence improves. CZK bonds and currency strengthen, yields may tighten modestly, reflecting reduced risk of populist policies.
