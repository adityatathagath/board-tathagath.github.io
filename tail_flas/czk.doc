Election Results & Government Formation
Election Outcome
•	Results came roughly in line with expectations, with no major surprises[amazonaws]
•	ANO party performed 4-5 percentage points higher than polls predicted[amazonaws]
•	SPD party performed 4-5 percentage points lower than expected[amazonaws]
•	These variations did not change the baseline scenario for post-election outlook[amazonaws]
Coalition Formation Requirements
•	Simple majority requires 101 MPs out of 200 total in parliament[amazonaws]
•	Expected coalition: ANO + Motorists + SPD[amazonaws]
•	President confirmed on Monday this coalition is likely[amazonaws]
Coalition Seat Distribution
•	ANO: 80 MPs[amazonaws]
•	Motorists: 13 MPs[amazonaws]
•	SPD: 15 MPs[amazonaws]
•	Total: 108 MPs (above the 101 threshold)[amazonaws]
•	SPD has 4 MPs from different parties, but even without them, coalition would have 104 MPs[amazonaws]
Timeline for Government Formation
•	President Pavel may give mandate in early November[amazonaws]
•	Coalition talks expected over the next three weeks[amazonaws]
•	Government starts working after receiving mandate without vote of confidence (per constitution)[amazonaws]
•	Vote of confidence required within 30 days of receiving mandate[amazonaws]
•	Official confirmation expected by late November or early December if negotiations proceed positively


Potential Coalition Challenges
Ministry Distribution Issues
•	SPD (ultra-left party) reportedly wants Interior and Justice ministries (two critical positions)[amazonaws]
•	This demand is likely to be rejected by ANO and Babiš[amazonaws]
EU and NATO Membership Concerns
•	SPD supported the idea of leaving EU and NATO during election campaign[amazonaws]
•	ANO and Motorists support EU and NATO membership[amazonaws]
•	SPD received much less than polls predicted (slightly less than 8%), suggesting they will not be in strong position to press unorthodox views[amazonaws]
•	Unlikely to change coalition direction on NATO and EU membership[amazonaws]
•	ANO party has extensive past experience managing smaller parties/political fractions in coalition governments[amazonaws]


Fiscal Policy Outlook
ANO Party’s Three Main Promises
1.	Revise indexation of pension salaries[amazonaws]
2.	Reduce corporate tax by 2 percentage points[amazonaws]
3.	Provide energy subsidies to low-income families[amazonaws]
Other Proposed Measures (Early Stage)
•	Subsidized mortgages for first-time buyers[amazonaws]
•	Public support to some SMEs and professions[amazonaws]
•	Many election promises typically revised after election[amazonaws]
•	Limited clarity on which measures will actually be adopted[amazonaws]
Budget Deficit Analysis
Historical and Current Levels
•	2024: Budget deficit at 2.3% of GDP[amazonaws]
•	2025: Expected at approximately 2.3% of GDP based on current trend[amazonaws]
•	As of September, 12-month trailing budget deficit very close to targeted 241 billion CZK[amazonaws]
2026 Projections
•	Pre-election preliminary target: 281 billion CZK (up from 241 billion CZK for 2025)[amazonaws]
•	Increase partly due to military spending and one-off expenditures[amazonaws]
•	Babiš signaled intention to increase budget deficit by additional 60 billion CZK for infrastructure spending[amazonaws]
Deficit Scenarios
•	Without new measures: Budget deficit likely at approximately 3.4% next year[amazonaws]
•	Expected outcome: Government will attempt to keep deficit below 3% to comply with EU rules and Maastricht criteria[amazonaws]
Proposed Revenue/Expenditure Measures (Uncertain Implementation)
•	Improve tax collection from shadow economy[amazonaws]
•	Cut support to Ukraine[amazonaws]
•	Fiscal impact unclear - not factored into deficit projections[amazonaws]
•	ANO also proposed to decrease military spending relative to initial proposals[amazonaws]


Monetary Policy Outlook
Central Bank Stance Drivers
•	Sticky services CPI highlighted by Central Bank[amazonaws]
•	September preliminary print showed no improvement on services inflation[amazonaws]
•	High real wage growth - one of the highest in the region[amazonaws]
•	Strong domestic economic activity expected to continue through remainder of 2025 and into 2026[amazonaws]
•	Expansionary fiscal policy/positive fiscal impulse adds another reason for Central Bank caution[amazonaws]
Base Case Forecast
•	Central Bank expected to remain on hold for remainder of 2025[amazonaws]
•	Expected to remain on hold through end of 2026[amazonaws]
•	Additional spending signals by Babiš support this view[amazonaws]
Risk Assessment
•	Primary risk direction: Clearly to the downside (potential for cuts, not hikes)[amazonaws]
•	Headline CPI likely to trend around or below 2.5% (in line with Central Bank’s inflation target)[amazonaws]
Downside Risk Factors
1.	Energy subsidies: Could create additional 1-1.5% downward pressure on headline inflation (per ANO proposal)[amazonaws]
2.	Potential changes in MPC member rhetoric/reaction function after government change (observed in many EM and DM countries)[amazonaws]
3.	Structural inflation factors: Some inflationary pressures (services, housing rents) driven by structural reasons rather than monetary policy[amazonaws]
4.	MPC signaling: Central Bank already indicated it’s not appropriate to hike rates to address structural inflation factors[amazonaws]
Upside Risk Factors (Very Limited)
•	Only major external risk factors (e.g., major jump in energy prices) could trigger hikes[amazonaws]
•	Hikes considered very unlikely[amazonaws]
Probability Assessment
•	Potential for one or two 25 basis point cuts represents the risk scenario[amazonaws]


Strategy View (Marik’s Analysis)
Pre-Election Price Action Analysis
Rates Market Behavior
•	Initial move driven by more resilient inflation than expected and more hawkish Central Bank[amazonaws]
•	Market went too far at some point[amazonaws]
•	Market started pricing terminal rate 50 basis points above current rate (implying potential future hikes)[amazonaws]
•	Market then focused on ANO’s fiscal expansion proposals[amazonaws]
Fiscal Risk Premium Assessment
•	30 basis point increase in 10-year rate would imply expectation of 1.5 percentage point deterioration in fiscal position[amazonaws]
•	Actual expected deterioration: approximately 0.9 percentage points even with full spending agenda[amazonaws]
•	Considering ANO’s intent to decrease military spending, target should be around 3% deficit[amazonaws]
•	This represents 0.5 percentage point deterioration from original plan[amazonaws]
•	Appropriate market pricing: only 10 basis points increase in back-end curve[amazonaws]
•	Conclusion: Market has gone too far, especially on rates side[amazonaws]
•	Market now fading these moves with momentum and room to continue[amazonaws]
FX Market Behavior
Pre-Election Positioning
•	FX went into election trading with zero premium despite tail risks[amazonaws]
•	FX was very robust, mainly driven by hawkish Central Bank communication[amazonaws]
•	Election outcome exactly in line with surveys - nothing surprising for FX to react to[amazonaws]
Tail Risk Assessment
•	FX should reflect tail risk more than it currently does[amazonaws]
•	Primary tail risk: Babiš and ANO policies with SPD shift toward more Erdogan-style or Hungarian path[amazonaws]
•	This has not been in nature of Babiš and ANO party historically[amazonaws]
•	Tail risk would most likely manifest during government formation, particularly regarding SPD and Motorists influence[amazonaws]
Base Case vs. Tail Risk Summary
•	Base case: Currency should not move (no premium currently reflected)[amazonaws]
•	Rates: Should fade pre-election pressures[amazonaws]
•	Tail risk scenario (speculation of Czech exit policies): Pressure should be more in currency space rather than rates (rates already embedded significant premium)[amazonaws]
Recommended Trade Strategy
Trade Sequence Priority
First Trade - Back-End Compression:
•	Position: Long Czech government bonds (back-end)[amazonaws]
•	Rationale: Market should fade fiscal risk premium once fiscal proposition becomes clear[amazonaws]
•	Babiš highlighted scope for deficit increase but only up to EU limits (3%)[amazonaws]
Second Trade - Front-End Positioning:
•	Position: Receive Czech 2-year 1-year versus Polish rates[amazonaws]
•	Rationale: Spread of terminal rates is mispriced[amazonaws]
•	Czech terminal rate should be significantly lower than Polish due to:
1.	50 basis points lower inflation target[amazonaws]
2.	Lower potential growth of Czech economy versus Poland[amazonaws]
3.	Very different and divergent fiscal positions between the two countries[amazonaws]
Currency Strategy
•	Outlook: More boring/subdued[amazonaws]
•	Corona has appreciated significantly over recent months[amazonaws]
•	Likely some follow-through in medium term[amazonaws]
•	Currently has no premium for tail risk[amazonaws]
•	Not the right time to build long Corona positions[amazonaws]
•	Wait for curve reaction first before considering FX positioning



Trading Desk View (Bruno’s Analysis)
FX Positioning
Current Market Setup
•	Market is pretty long Czech, short EUR/CZK[amazonaws]
•	Positioning reflective of C3 region as a whole where carry plays have worked well since start of year[amazonaws]
•	EUR/CZK is now a few percent below Central Bank’s forecast[amazonaws]
•	This is starting to feed through into inflation[amazonaws]
•	Currency has had a pretty good run[amazonaws]
Post-Election Behavior
•	No real position reduction post-election[amazonaws]
•	Marik has view for EUR/CZK going higher with definite tail risk[amazonaws]
•	However, entire C3 region trades so well on FX side that it’s hard to fight against[amazonaws]
•	EUR/HUF sell-off yesterday was quickly faded today, everything continuing to grind back lower[amazonaws]
Trading Recommendation - FX
•	No massive trade opportunity currently[amazonaws]
•	Positioning is fairly high[amazonaws]
•	No huge value in trying to fade the move higher at the moment[amazonaws]
•	Babiš seems to be behaving himself[amazonaws]
•	No tails materializing expected in next couple of months[amazonaws]
Rates Positioning
Curve Dynamics
•	Not much premium in back-end duration[amazonaws]
•	Move has been outright story - entire curve has shifted higher[amazonaws]
•	Five-to-tens curve measures (3-year 2-year, 5-year 5-year, steepness and term premium measures) have compressed significantly from highs at start of year[amazonaws]
•	Compression trend continued during election period[amazonaws]
•	Outright levels have moved significantly higher while curve has flattened[amazonaws]
Positioning Details
•	Large payer positions from model accounts (CTA)[amazonaws]
•	Large discretionary payer positions from a couple of large names[amazonaws]
•	These positions have dominated market for last few months[amazonaws]
Positioning Stability Analysis
•	CTA model positions: Not going to stop out, won’t move dynamically[amazonaws]
•	Discretionary pay positions: Not from fast money names that chop around[amazonaws]
•	Conclusion: These are not marginal market movers at the moment[amazonaws]
Post-Election Activity
•	Fair amount of duration receivers adding positions, especially in the belly[amazonaws]
•	Continental real money has been active[amazonaws]
•	Several hundred thousand in belly receiving put through this week[amazonaws]
•	Fast money coming into 5-year 5-year[amazonaws]
Specific Trade Recommendations - Rates
Preferred Positioning
•	Best place to play: Front-end (1-year 1-year, 2-year 1-year area)[amazonaws]
•	Rationale: Steepness in 1-to-3-year sector[amazonaws]
•	This view was flagged heading into election[amazonaws]
Recent Performance Validation
•	5-year 5-year went higher on Monday[amazonaws]
•	Front-end moved lower at some points[amazonaws]
•	Front-end positioning has performed very well to start the week[amazonaws]
Positioning Concerns - 5-Year 5-Year
•	Much more positioned than 2-year and 3-year[amazonaws]
•	Holders are smaller pod names (fast money)[amazonaws]
•	These traders will take profit and chop around quickly[amazonaws]
•	Will pay the dip quite quickly to make quick 10 basis points and move on[amazonaws]
•	Limited value given not much premium in the curve[amazonaws]
Alternative Front-End Entry Points
•	2-year 2-year: Reached 405 basis points at some points last week[amazonaws]
•	Represents much better outright level to enter positions[amazonaws]
Energy Subsidy Impact (Tail Consideration)
Potential Inflation Impact
•	Energy subsidies proposed by ANO estimated at 1-1.5% reduction on headline inflation[amazonaws]
•	If headline inflation collapses due to subsidies, very hard for curve to keep current shape[amazonaws]
•	Significant pressure on CNB with real rates at 2-2.5% to cut and bring policy rate down[amazonaws]
Political Pressure Factors
•	Babiš expressed strong desire to bring down inflation and cost of living[amazonaws]
•	SPD also talking extensively about reducing cost of living[amazonaws]
Overall Risk Assessment
•	Most value: Further in the curve (front-end)[amazonaws]
•	No real trigger for hikes coming from Babiš’s policies in short run[amazonaws]
•	Tail risk is skewed lower in 1-year 1-year and 2-year 1-year[amazonaws]


Consensus Summary
Key Agreements Across Speakers
1.	Fiscal expansion less severe than priced: Expected deficit around 3% (0.5pp deterioration from original plan) versus market pricing implying 1.5pp deterioration[amazonaws]
2.	Rates market overreacted: Pre-election rate sell-off excessive relative to actual fiscal risk[amazonaws +1]
3.	Central Bank to remain on hold: Base case through end of 2026[amazonaws]
4.	Risks skewed to rate cuts: One or two 25bp cuts represent the risk scenario, not hikes[amazonaws]
5.	FX tail risk underpriced: Currency reflects zero premium despite political tail risks[amazonaws]
6.	Risk-reward favors fixed income: Despite fiscal intentions, downside risks to rates and skew of policy risks favor receivers[amazonaws]
7.	FX weaker of two asset classes: If downside risks from policy/macro materialize, FX more vulnerable than rates[amazonaws]
Strategic Positioning Summary
•	Rates: Fade the sell-off, receive duration particularly in front-end
•	FX: Wait for more clarity, no immediate value in fighting carry dynamics
•	Curve: Front-end offers better value than 5y5y; 2y1y vs Poland preferred expression
•	Risk management: Monitor government formation process, particularly SPD influence and any signals toward EU/NATO skepticism
