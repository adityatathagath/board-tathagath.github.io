Potential Trump-Xi APEC meeting could provide de-escalation opportunity

China's retaliatory measures expanding beyond tariffs to sanctions

2. Central Bank Policy Divergence​

Fed on clear easing path (97% probability of October cut)

ECB maintaining steady stance with minimal cut probability in 2025

BoJ gradually normalizing but cautious on tightening pace

RBNZ aggressively easing to combat weak growth

3. Economic Data Uncertainty​

US government shutdown complicating Fed decision-making

Delayed CPI and jobs reports creating information vacuum

September employment data still unreleased​

4. Corporate Earnings Strength​

Q3 financials beating expectations significantly

Investment banking and trading revenues surging

8% S&P 500 earnings growth expected​

5. Geopolitical Risks​

Middle East tensions easing with Gaza ceasefire

US-China relations deteriorating

France political uncertainty persisting

Downside Risks
Trade War Escalation: 100% tariff implementation could trigger significant market selloff and global growth slowdown​

Inflation Persistence: US core CPI at 3.1% complicating Fed easing path​

China Deflation: 36 consecutive months of PPI deflation signaling structural demand weakness​

Data Vacuum: Government shutdown preventing informed policy decisions​

UK Inflation: Highest in G7 limiting BoE policy flexibility​

Upside Catalysts
Fed Rate Cuts: 97% probability providing liquidity and supporting risk assets​

Strong Earnings: Q3 results beating expectations, particularly in financials​

EM Resilience: Nine-month rally with positive medium-term outlook​

Oil Price Decline: Lower energy costs reducing inflationary pressures​

Trade De-escalation: Potential Trump-Xi meeting could ease tensions​

CONCLUSION
The week of October 13-18, 2025 represents a critical inflection point for global macro markets. While strong corporate earnings and dovish central bank pivots provide support, escalating US-China trade tensions and persistent inflation create significant headwinds. The delayed US economic data releases due to the government shutdown add an additional layer of uncertainty to an already complex environment.

For macro asset class positioning, the following considerations are paramount:

Fixed Income: US Treasuries benefiting from safe-haven flows and rate cut expectations, with 10-year yields near 4%​

Equities: Volatility likely to persist (VIX at 19.03) as markets navigate trade tensions, though strong earnings provide fundamental support​

Commodities: Gold at record highs ($4,200+/oz) reflecting multiple tailwinds; oil under pressure from supply surplus outlook​

FX: Dollar strength likely to moderate as Fed cuts materialize; EM currencies positioned to outperform on policy framework improvements​

The IMF's October 2025 World Economic Outlook's downward growth revisions and emphasis on policy credibility underscore the challenging environment ahead. Market participants should maintain flexibility and robust risk management frameworks as this pivotal week unfolds.​

France – Latest Updates
Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has proposed suspending the highly unpopular pension reform law until after the 2027 presidential election as his new government faces two no-confidence motions in Parliament; the Socialist Party’s decision not to back the motions has eased market anxieties for now, with the next risk event being Thursday’s crucial confidence votes.​

Ongoing political uncertainty is weighing on France’s economic outlook and business confidence, with GDP growth projected at only 0.6% this year and increased investor wariness visible in higher bond yields and volatility in the CAC 40 equity index.​


First, US-China tensions have escalated sharply, with President Trump announcing 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods effective Nov 1. China has responded by expanding sanctions, imposing port fees, and tightening export controls, which enforces global supply chain and manufacturing risks.

Second, the US government shutdown has persisted into its third week, delaying key data releases like jobs and CPI. This complicates Federal Reserve decision-making and fuels risk-off sentiment, pushing up demand for Treasuries and gold, and raising concerns about Q4 GDP growth ahead of the November FOMC meeting.

In the Middle East, an Israel-Gaza ceasefire has paused major conflict, following a US-brokered deal to release hostages and detainees. However, violence continues sporadically and long-term disputes, especially over Hamas’ future role, remain unresolved.

On the data side, China’s latest inflation figures show persistent deflation—CPI at -0.3% year-on-year and PPI at -2.3%. Japan remains steady, but with expectations for a possible rate hike if inflation stays below 2%. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised markets by raising rates 50bps to 2.5%, double the anticipated cut.

US Government Shutdown – Latest Updates
The US government shutdown has entered its third week, delaying major economic data releases including the September jobs report and October CPI, which complicates Federal Reserve policy decisions and heightens uncertainty in financial markets.​

Prolonged budget gridlock is fueling risk-off sentiment, boosting safe-haven demand in Treasuries and gold, and raising concerns about impact on Q4 GDP growth and public services ahead of the expected November FOMC rate cut.​

Here is an analysis of yesterday’s (October 14, 2025) FOMC minutes:

FOMC Minutes – Key Analysis (October 14, 2025)
The committee showed continued division over rate policy direction and pace, but most members agreed further rate cuts are justified due to labor market softness and elevated downside risks to economic growth. While a minority remained concerned about persistent above-target inflation—especially risks tied to new tariffs—a majority concluded that inflationary pressures are stable or diminished and opined that monetary policy should shift toward supporting employment.​

The minutes confirmed high market expectations for two additional quarter-point rate cuts this year (October and December). The lack of fresh data (especially jobs and CPI, delayed by the government shutdown) complicated the policy debate, but the Fed indicated flexibility and readiness to take further action if economic conditions deteriorate. Policy guidance emphasized a “meeting-by-meeting” approach and ongoing monitoring of labor market weakness, trade war effects, and inflation developments.​

These points will strengthen slides conveying the Fed’s dovish pivot, policy uncertainty from missing data, and the evolving risk assessment in the current macro environment.


The image shows a decision tree mapping the French budget approval process. At the top, the government must secure support for its budget (A). If successful, we move to budget adoption. If not, two branches emerge:

The first branch (B) outlines scenarios where the budget faces uncertain adoption, including special laws and last-minute measures to ensure continued tax collection.

The second branch (D) covers agreements with the Socialist Party, which could result in compromises like suspending pension reforms or raising taxes. These are shown as further split into scenarios for broad fiscal laws (C), Socialist fiscal demands (E), and the risk of early elections (F).

For special laws (C), fiscal flexibility is lost and the deficit remains elevated. Under Socialist agreement (E), some tax hikes and pension suspensions occur, but deficit reduction is limited. If neither path succeeds (F), early legislative elections — with a 20 to 40-day window — are likely, increasing political and market risk.

In short, the flowchart highlights how every scenario ultimately risks budget rigidity or political instability, both of which matter significantly for French market risk this year."

Japan remains steady, but with expectations for a possible rate hike if inflation stays below 2%. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised markets by raising rates 50bps to 2.5%, double the anticipated cut.

For upcoming key geopolitical events, two things are worth highlighting:

First, we may see a Trump-Xi summit in late October, which could be pivotal for setting the direction of US-China relations and global supply chains. Any outcomes from this meeting have the potential to impact tariffs, technology policy, and broader risk sentiment, particularly for companies with significant China exposure.

Second, the Canadian federal elections are expected by October 20. The results here could influence the direction of NAFTA and broader trade policy, which may have spillover effects for North American markets and cross-border businesses.
