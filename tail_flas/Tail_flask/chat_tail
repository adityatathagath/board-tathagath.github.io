The most relevant themes from Bank of England MPC member Megan Greene’s recent speeches that matter to markets include her cautious stance on monetary policy, concerns over inflation persistence, and the increased importance of supply-side shocks.

Cautious Approach to Rate Cuts
Greene has advocated for a more cautious pace regarding interest rate cuts. She warns that there are considerable risks inflation could turn out stronger than the Bank’s forecasts, mainly because of continued supply-side pressures and lingering effects of recent global shocks (pandemic, energy prices linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine). As such, Greene is not convinced that monetary policy is “meaningfully restrictive” yet and argues that rate cuts should not proceed as quickly as markets might anticipate.​

Inflation Risks and Second-Round Effects
She often highlights the risk of inflation persistence, emphasizing that inflation expectations among households are still elevated. This remains a critical factor for policy, as high expectations can feed into wage and price-setting, potentially entrenching higher inflation. While recent wage data was softer than expected, survey data suggest next year’s wage settlements could remain uncomfortably high. Greene is concerned that temporary price jumps, such as in regulated bills (e.g., water), could trigger more enduring price and wage increases.​

Supply-Side Shocks and Policy Changes
A recurring theme in Greene’s speeches is that central banks should pay much more attention to supply-side developments. She argues that the frequency and importance of supply shocks—like those from climate change or geopolitical developments—are increasing, which means that the era of “looking through” such disruptions has ended. The Bank of England is now reforming its approach, increasingly relying on scenario analysis to better understand and respond to these shocks.​

Markets’ Takeaways
Expectations for UK rate cuts are being pushed back; investors now see the next possible reduction only by March 2026.​

The Bank of England is increasingly data-dependent, putting emphasis on incoming inflation and labor market data which are having bigger market effects than before.​

Markets are sensitive to the risk of second-round effects from shocks, especially where price and wage-setting might shift more rapidly than in the past.​

In sum, Greene’s speeches signal that UK monetary policy is likely to remain cautious, with persistent inflation risks, more weight on supply-side shocks, and an enhanced role for scenario analysis and risk management. These are critical for market participants in interpreting the Bank of England’s evolving stance.
