Here are the key points from the latest Hungary Central Bank (Magyar Nemzeti Bank, MNB) meeting (November 2025):

Policy Decision: The central bank maintained its base interest rate at 6.50%, unchanged for the twelfth consecutive meeting. The overnight deposit and collateralized loan rates also remained steady at 5.5% and 7.5%, respectively.​

Reasoning: The policy stance reflects a continued focus on stability amidst persistent inflation pressures, geopolitical risks, and fiscal stimulus ahead of elections. The Council noted elevated inflation expectations and sees risks of further pro-inflationary shocks — especially as new government support measures (tax cuts, housing subsidies, wage hikes) are introduced.​

Economic Outlook:

Growth: The Hungarian economy is recovering slowly, with retail sales expanding modestly, but industrial output and construction falling. Consumption and business confidence have improved but remain low.​

Forecasts: Growth is expected to accelerate slightly in 2025, driven mainly by private consumption, but external weaknesses and trade uncertainty persist. GDP growth projections for 2025 range from 0.9% (OECD) to 1.8% (European Commission) and 2.8-3.8% (Fitch, S&P, IMF).​

Inflation: Inflation remains above target. The bank does not expect to reach its 3% inflation goal until 2027. Risks remain from wage growth, fiscal stimulus, and removal of price caps.​

Monetary Policy Stance: The Monetary Council reaffirmed its tight policy approach and a “careful and patient” stance, highlighting that rate cuts are unlikely in the near term. The rate corridor stays at +/- 1% around the base rate.​

Fiscal Policy Update: The government widened its budget deficit targets for 2025/2026 (to ~5% of GDP), which increases fiscal impulse and pro-inflationary risks in anticipation of elections.​

Market Reaction: The forint held strong, but long-end bond yields and dollar spreads rose slightly after the government signaled looser fiscal policy.​

Summary Statements:

The MNB kept rates unchanged due to sustained inflation risks and upcoming fiscal stimulus.

The inflation target is unlikely to be met until 2027, so tight monetary conditions are warranted.

Growth outlook is mildly positive but vulnerable to external demand and government actions.

Monetary easing is not expected soon, with possible minor cuts after elections, but consensus believes rates will stay at 6.5% throughout 2025.
