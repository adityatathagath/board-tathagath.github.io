### Global Macro Update (July 7–15, 2025)

#### United States

Over the past week, the U.S. economy was marked by a significant rise in inflation, driven mainly by new tariffs. The June CPI rose to 2.7% year-over-year, up notably from 2.4% previously, with core inflation reaching approximately 2.9%. This has led to market adjustments, with Treasury yields rising sharply across all maturities. As a result, expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts have moderated, with markets now pricing in a modest 25 basis-point cut in September at the earliest.

Trade policy remained a key concern, with the Trump administration announcing fresh tariffs of 19% on imports from Indonesia and reiterating plans for substantial tariffs on goods from the EU, Mexico, and Canada. The market responded with heightened volatility, though strong earnings from major banks, notably Citigroup and JPMorgan, offered some support to investor sentiment.

#### United Kingdom and Europe

The UK experienced an unexpected spike in inflation, with June CPI climbing to 3.6%, the highest since January 2024. This rise has significantly diminished the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England in August. Gilt yields increased, and the pound strengthened in response to these inflation figures.

In the broader Eurozone, geopolitical trade tensions remain elevated, with Germany signaling potential counter-tariffs against the U.S. European markets, particularly in Frankfurt and Paris, exhibited volatility amid these concerns. European Central Bank officials have expressed caution, noting the combined pressure from tariff threats and euro appreciation on their inflation and growth outlook.

#### Asia-Pacific

China’s second-quarter GDP growth came in at a stable 5.2%, reassuring markets but failing to generate strong optimism due to persistent concerns over global trade dynamics. In Japan, the yen weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar, reaching around 149 JPY/USD, as markets speculated the Bank of Japan might pause its normalization process in response to global uncertainty.

South Korea's market was notably resilient, led by technology sector gains, while Australian markets cautiously recovered. Attention in Australia is turning towards upcoming inflation data and potential implications for the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy path.

#### India

India stood out positively with a substantial easing in inflation. June CPI dropped to a multi-year low range of 2.1–2.8% year-over-year, significantly below RBI’s upper target. The Reserve Bank of India has thus signaled openness to additional rate cuts later this year, potentially in October or December. India's GDP growth outlook remains strong at approximately 6.5–6.7% for FY25–26, underpinned by robust capital expenditure and positive monsoon forecasts.

The rupee strengthened slightly against the dollar, reflecting the divergence between RBI's easing bias and the Federal Reserve’s relatively cautious stance. Forward premiums tightened as markets adjusted to this evolving policy differential.

#### Commodities and Alternative Assets

Precious metals saw increased safe-haven demand, with silver notably rising to around \$36.50 per ounce. Gold remained stable near \$3,375 per ounce. Copper prices benefited from tariff-induced supply chain concerns, while oil prices remained subdued, reflecting uncertainty around global demand.

Cryptocurrency markets saw Bitcoin retrace slightly from its recent all-time high above \$123,000, though continued institutional interest, especially linked to artificial intelligence-driven applications, maintained overall positive sentiment.

#### Global Themes and Strategic Outlook

The dominant global theme continues to be trade policy uncertainty, specifically U.S.-initiated tariffs, influencing inflation dynamics, FX movements, and bond market volatility. Major trading desks are responding by positioning cautiously—favoring selective risk exposure and strategic hedges.

Strategically, trading desks are positioning for:

* Continued USD strength, particularly against JPY and EUR.
* Short-end interest rate cuts in India and potentially the U.S., balanced by careful management of duration risk.
* Sector rotations from large-cap tech toward cyclicals and value stocks.
* Tactical long positions in silver and copper to hedge trade uncertainty.

Upcoming catalysts include monetary policy decisions from the Bank of England, Federal Reserve, and Reserve Bank of India, alongside critical economic data releases such as UK CPI, Australian inflation, and continued monitoring of trade negotiations between major global economies.

This comprehensive overview should provide clarity on current market dynamics and inform our strategic approach moving forward.
