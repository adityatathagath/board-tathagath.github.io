I currently send out daily DVaR and SVaR tail data for the Macro business, along with sub-businesses like Rates, FX, and EM Macro. Now there’s an ask to include additional context showing the Day-over-Day (DoD) movement of key risk factors versus their tail contributions.

I already have the following data for ~260 trading days:
	•	Top DVaR/SVaR tail contributors (by risk factor)
	•	Time series of risk factor prices
	•	Daily returns for these risk factors

Can you help me clearly understand what exactly this new ask is trying to achieve?
Also, given the data I have, what is the best way to visualize or report this comparison of price movements vs tail risks?
I want to highlight cases where tail risks appear large even when market moves are small, to help the team understand position-driven risks or hidden sensitivities.
Please suggest a structured approach with the best chart types, analysis techniques, and reporting format I can use.
