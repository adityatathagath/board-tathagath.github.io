**Strengthening Our Partnership with Army Institute of Technology, Pune**

We recently had the privilege of visiting the Army Institute of Technology, Pune, for our Graduate Hiring Program. This visit marks our third consecutive year of engagement with the institute, reaffirming our commitment to fostering strong relationships with institutions that share our values.

During our visit, we conducted a comprehensive pre-placement presentation, where we introduced the students to our organization, our core values, and the opportunities we offer. As an institution with a student body composed of the wards of army personnel, AIT holds a unique place in our diversity and inclusivity initiatives.

Recognizing the potential of these talented individuals, we are planning to enhance our collaboration with AIT through the introduction of tailored courses and training programs designed to equip students with the skills necessary for success in the industry. We are dedicated to building a long-term partnership with the institute, one that empowers the wards of army personnel and ex-army individuals, reflecting our commitment to diversity and inclusion.

We look forward to continuing our engagement with AIT Pune and contributing to the development of the next generation of leaders.
