The Indian Rupee's Journey: An Analysis of USD/INR Exchange Rate Dynamics (1947-2025)
I. Introduction
 * Purpose and Scope
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical trajectory of the United States Dollar (USD) versus the Indian Rupee (INR) exchange rate, spanning the period from India's independence in 1947 to projections for 2025. The primary objective is to identify significant movements and turning points in the USD/INR exchange rate and to provide detailed explanations for these changes. The analysis delves into the interplay of critical factors, including the prevailing political environment, fiscal conditions (budget balance/deficit), trade dynamics (balance of trade, import/export shocks), monetary factors (currency circulation, inflation, central bank policies), economic performance (growth, earnings), and investment flows (Foreign Direct Investment - FDI, Foreign Institutional Investment - FII). The analysis relies exclusively on data and information from credible sources such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, Government of India publications (including Economic Surveys), academic research, and reputable financial data providers.
 * Evolution of Exchange Rate Regimes
India's exchange rate regime has undergone a significant transformation since 1947. Initially, under the Bretton Woods agreement, the INR was pegged to the Pound Sterling. Following the collapse of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s, India briefly pegged the INR to the USD and then shifted to pegging it against a basket of currencies of major trading partners in 1975 to manage volatility. A major paradigm shift occurred following the Balance of Payments (BoP) crisis of 1991. This led to a transition through the Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System (LERMS), a dual exchange rate system introduced in 1992, before moving to a unified, market-determined exchange rate system (a managed float) in 1993. Since then, the RBI has managed the exchange rate, intervening to curb excessive volatility while allowing market forces to play a greater role. A further refinement occurred with the formal adoption of a flexible inflation targeting (IT) framework in 2016, making price stability the primary nominal anchor for monetary policy, though debates continue regarding the extent of exchange rate management versus a true float.
 * Key Influencing Factors (Overview)
The journey of the INR against the USD has been shaped by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. As requested, this report will examine the influence of:
*   Political Environment: Stability, policy direction, geopolitical events, and reforms.
*   Fiscal Situation: Government spending, revenue, budget deficits, and public debt.
*   Trade Situation: Balance of trade, current account balance, export competitiveness, and import dependence (especially oil).
*   Monetary Conditions: Inflation rates (WPI, CPI), money supply, and currency in circulation.
*   Economic Growth: GDP growth rates, sectoral performance, and overall economic health.
*   Investment Flows: The volume and volatility of FDI and FII inflows/outflows.
*   Central Bank Policies: RBI's stance on interest rates, liquidity management, forex intervention, reserve management, and the overall monetary/exchange rate policy framework.
 * Data Sources & Methodology
The analysis presented herein is grounded in data sourced from official and reputable institutions. Primary data sources include the Reserve Bank of India's publications and databases (such as the Database on Indian Economy - DBIE, and the Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy), reports and data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Indian Government Economic Surveys, and data from recognized financial information providers. The methodology involves identifying significant shifts in the USD/INR exchange rate trend and correlating these shifts with contemporaneous developments in the aforementioned political and economic factors.

II. The Early Years (1947-1966): Post-Independence Stability and the First Major Devaluation
 * Initial Peg & Bretton Woods Context (1947-1949)
Upon achieving independence in 1947, India adopted the prevailing global monetary framework established by the Bretton Woods agreement. Contrary to popular myth suggesting parity (1 USD = 1 INR), the Indian Rupee was initially pegged to the British Pound Sterling (£) at a rate of £1 = ₹13.33. At that time, the Pound Sterling itself was pegged to the US Dollar at $4.03 per £1. This cross-rate mechanism resulted in an initial USD/INR exchange rate of approximately ₹3.30 per USD. The political environment was marked by the challenges of partition, nation-building under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and the establishment of new economic institutions, amidst considerable uncertainty about the stability of the newly independent nation. The initial focus was on consolidating the nation and laying the groundwork for planned economic development.
 * The 1949 Devaluation
The first significant change in the USD/INR rate occurred in September 1949. The trigger was external: the devaluation of the Pound Sterling against the US Dollar, with the peg changing from $4.03 to $2.80 per £1. As India was part of the Sterling Area and its currency was directly linked to the Pound, the INR was devalued simultaneously and by the same proportion. This resulted in a new, stable peg of ₹4.76 per USD. The immediate economic impact was felt primarily in trade relations with the dollar area, while trade within the Sterling Area was less affected. This event also marked the beginning of a period where India started experiencing persistent trade deficits, a trend that would continue for decades. The RBI's policy was dictated by the Bretton Woods system, focusing on maintaining the fixed peg.
 * Period of Stability (1950-1965): Fixed Rate, Growing Pressures
For the subsequent 17 years, the USD/INR exchange rate remained fixed at ₹4.76. This period of nominal stability, however, masked growing underlying macroeconomic pressures. Politically, it was the Nehruvian era, characterized by a focus on a state-led, planned economy emphasizing Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI). A significant domestic monetary event was the decimalisation of the currency in 1957, dividing the Rupee into 100 Naye Paise (later Paise) instead of 16 Annas.
On the fiscal front, government budget deficits began to emerge and grow, driven by development expenditures under the Five-Year Plans. A portion of these deficits was financed through the issuance of bonds to the RBI (deficit financing), leading to an expansion of the money supply and nascent inflationary pressures. Data indicates a rising trend in the budget deficit as a percentage of total government expenditure during this period. The trade situation deteriorated steadily, with persistent trade deficits widening, particularly in the 1960s. This was partly a consequence of the ISI strategy, which required significant imports of capital goods while doing little to promote exports. Severe restrictions on international trade were imposed from 1957 onwards to manage the balance of payments. To finance these growing trade deficits, India became increasingly reliant on foreign aid. The RBI, while maintaining the fixed exchange rate, introduced measures like export subsidies and import tariffs in the early 1960s, which some analysts considered a "de facto" devaluation aimed at mitigating the BoP pressure.
The prolonged stability of the INR at ₹4.76 per USD between 1949 and 1966 obscured fundamental weaknesses accumulating within the economy. The fixed exchange rate regime, a hallmark of the Bretton Woods system, lacked the mechanism to adjust automatically to the growing fiscal imbalances, persistent trade deficits fueled by the inward-looking ISI strategy, and the resultant inflationary pressures. An increasingly overvalued Rupee (due to domestic inflation outpacing that of trading partners) further exacerbated the trade deficit by making imports cheaper and exports less competitive. The economy's ability to sustain this fixed rate became heavily dependent on the continuous inflow of foreign aid to bridge the external financing gap. This created a significant vulnerability, as the subsequent crisis would demonstrate.
 * Lead-up to and Analysis of the 1966 Devaluation
The breaking point came in the mid-1960s, triggered by a confluence of severe shocks. Wars with China (1962) and Pakistan (1965) placed immense strain on government finances, with defence spending reaching a peak. A severe drought in 1965-66 devastated agricultural output and exacerbated already rising inflation. Crucially, the 1965 war led the United States and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to suspend foreign aid to India. This cut-off of essential foreign exchange inflows, coupled with the existing pressures of high inflation that had rendered the Rupee significantly overvalued, precipitated a severe BoP crisis.
The reliance on foreign aid proved to be a critical point of failure. Its abrupt withdrawal, directly linked to geopolitical developments following the 1965 war, removed the primary means of financing the persistent deficits. India was informed that further aid would be conditional on liberalizing its restrictive trade regime. Faced with depleted foreign exchange reserves and mounting external pressure, the government was forced to act. In June 1966, the INR was devalued by a substantial 57.5% against the USD, establishing a new rate of ₹7.50 per USD. The devaluation was accompanied by attempts at trade liberalization, but these efforts largely faltered due to the political unpopularity of the move (seen as capitulation to external pressure) and the immediate priority of managing the drought's impact. The 1966 devaluation was thus not merely a response to short-term shocks but the culmination of years of accumulated macroeconomic stress under an inflexible exchange rate regime, finally triggered by the withdrawal of external support.
III. Navigating Global Shifts (1966-1991): Basket Peg and Rising Vulnerabilities
 * Post-Devaluation Adjustments & Bretton Woods Collapse (1966-1975)
Following the 1966 devaluation, the INR settled at ₹7.50 per USD. The global monetary landscape, however, was itself in flux. The Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates began to unravel, culminating in the "Nixon Shock" of 1971, when the US suspended the dollar's convertibility to gold, and the subsequent Smithsonian Agreement, which attempted to realign currencies but ultimately led to generalized floating of major currencies.
In response to this global instability, India initially linked the Rupee solely to the Pound Sterling in December 1971. However, recognizing the vulnerabilities associated with a single-currency peg in a floating rate world, India shifted its exchange rate regime again in September 1975. The Rupee was pegged to a basket of currencies of its major trading partners, with the Pound Sterling retained as the intervention currency. The specific composition and weights of the basket were kept confidential by the RBI. This move aimed to provide greater stability to the INR's effective exchange rate amidst fluctuations among major world currencies. During this period, the USD/INR rate gradually moved from ₹7.50 towards ₹8.39 by 1975. Domestically, the economic strategy remained largely inward-looking, with continued import substitution policies and stringent foreign exchange controls formalized under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) of 1973, which was even stricter than its 1947 predecessor. The first global oil shock in 1973 significantly impacted India's import bill and contributed to inflationary pressures. The political scene was dominated by Indira Gandhi's government, including the period of the Emergency (1975-77).
 * The Basket Peg Era (1975-1990): Managed Depreciation and Growing Debt
Under the basket peg system, the USD/INR exchange rate exhibited a clear trend of gradual, managed depreciation throughout the late 1970s and the 1980s. The rate moved from ₹8.39 in 1975 to ₹7.86 in 1980, then depreciated more rapidly to ₹12.38 by 1985, and further to around ₹17.01-₹17.50 by 1990. This consistent depreciation suggests that the RBI was actively managing the peg, allowing the Rupee to adjust downwards, likely to offset inflation differentials relative to trading partners and maintain some level of export competitiveness in the face of structural rigidities.
However, this managed depreciation occurred against a backdrop of deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals. The political environment saw changes in government and increasing instability towards the end of the decade. Fiscal discipline weakened considerably during the 1980s, with persistent and growing budget deficits at both the central and state levels. The central government's fiscal deficit rose from 6.1% of GDP at the start of the decade to 8.4% by the end, while the combined deficit surged from 9.0% to 12.7% of GDP. Government expenditure expanded rapidly without a corresponding increase in revenues, leading to increased borrowing and continued monetization of deficits by the RBI, fueling inflationary pressures. Net interest payments consumed a growing share of government expenditure.
The external position also weakened significantly. The Current Account Deficit (CAD) widened substantially, particularly in the second half of the 1980s, averaging 2.2% of GDP compared to 1.3% in the first half. While some limited trade liberalization measures were attempted, the overall policy framework remained protectionist. To finance the twin deficits (fiscal and current account), India increasingly resorted to external borrowing. Crucially, the nature of this borrowing shifted away from concessional aid towards more expensive and volatile sources like commercial debt and deposits from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). Consequently, India's external debt nearly doubled from approximately $35 billion in 1984/85 to $69 billion by 1990/91, rising from 12% to 23% of GDP over the decade. The share of short-term debt in the total also grew sharply, increasing vulnerability. The RBI continued to manage the basket peg, but foreign exchange reserves began to dwindle relative to import cover, falling to a precarious level of just 4.8 weeks of imports by 1990.
The shift to a basket peg in 1975 indeed offered more operational flexibility compared to the rigid pre-1966 single-currency peg, enabling the RBI to guide the Rupee lower through the late 1970s and 1980s. This managed depreciation likely aimed to prevent a significant overvaluation and support exports to some extent. However, the scale of the macroeconomic imbalances accumulating during the 1980s – particularly the unsustainable fiscal deficits driving the current account deficit – proved too large for gradual exchange rate adjustments to resolve. The managed depreciation was insufficient to counteract the deep-seated structural problems and the growing reliance on external borrowing.
The composition of this external borrowing became a critical vulnerability. The increasing reliance on commercial loans, NRI deposits, and especially short-term debt during the 1980s marked a significant departure from the earlier dependence on more stable, long-term concessional aid. These market-based flows were far more sensitive to changes in global interest rates, liquidity conditions, and, crucially, investor confidence. This heightened sensitivity set the stage for the crisis that unfolded at the decade's end.
 * Lead-up to and Analysis of the 1991 BoP Crisis
The precarious situation culminated in a full-blown Balance of Payments crisis in 1990-91. The immediate trigger was the first Gulf War (August 1990 - February 1991). The conflict led to a sharp spike in global oil prices, adding an estimated $2 billion to India's import bill. It also disrupted export markets (particularly the Soviet Union, a key trading partner facing its own turmoil), caused a decline in remittances from Indian workers in the Gulf region, and incurred costs associated with repatriating citizens. Compounding these external shocks was a slowdown in global economic growth, notably in the US, India's largest single export market.
These shocks hit an economy already severely weakened by underlying vulnerabilities: persistent high fiscal and current account deficits, a large and rapidly growing external debt burden with a significant short-term component, critically low foreign exchange reserves (falling to around $1 billion at one point, sufficient for only a few weeks of imports), heightened political uncertainty following changes in government, and a consequent loss of international investor confidence, reflected in downgrades by credit rating agencies. Access to external commercial borrowing dried up, and NRI deposit outflows accelerated.
Initial attempts by the government to manage the crisis through traditional import compression measures proved inadequate. Facing the prospect of default, India sought emergency financing from the IMF and World Bank, resorting to pledging its gold reserves as collateral to raise funds. The crisis forced a fundamental rethinking of India's economic strategy. As an immediate stabilization measure, the INR was devalued in two steps on July 1 and July 3, 1991, by a cumulative 18-19% against the US Dollar. This marked the end of the pegged exchange rate regime and paved the way for comprehensive structural reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy. The USD/INR rate moved sharply from around ₹17-18/$ to over ₹22.74 in 1991 and further to ₹25.92 by 1992.
IV. Liberalization Era (1991-2000): Reforms, Recovery, and Resilience
 * The 1991 Reforms and Exchange Rate Management
The 1991 BoP crisis served as a catalyst for a fundamental shift in India's economic policy, moving away from the decades-long strategy of import substitution and state control towards liberalization and greater integration with the global economy. Spearheaded by Finance Minister Manmohan Singh under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, the reforms were swift and far-reaching.
Key reforms directly impacting the external sector and exchange rate included the initial two-step devaluation in July 1991. This was followed in March 1992 by the introduction of the Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System (LERMS), a transitional dual exchange rate mechanism where 60% of export earnings and remittances could be converted at the market-determined rate, while the remaining 40% was converted at the official rate (used for essential imports like oil, fertilizers, and government debt service). This system aimed to ease the transition towards a fully market-based rate. LERMS was abolished in March 1993, unifying the exchange rate and moving India to a managed float system, where the rate was largely determined by market demand and supply, although the RBI retained the right to intervene to smooth excessive volatility. Complementing these exchange rate reforms were significant trade liberalization measures, including the dismantling of the complex import licensing regime ('License Raj') for most goods and substantial reductions in customs tariffs. The economy was also opened up to foreign investment, both direct (FDI) and portfolio (FII), albeit with sectoral caps and regulations. Industrial licensing was largely abolished, and financial sector reforms, based on the Narasimham Committee recommendations, were initiated. A major milestone was making the Rupee convertible on the current account, allowing for freer trade-related transactions.
Following the sharp devaluation and the move to a market-determined rate, the USD/INR exchange rate stabilized initially and then entered a phase of gradual depreciation under the managed float regime. The rate moved from around ₹26/$ in 1992 to ₹31.40 in 1995, ₹35.43 in 1996, ₹36.31 in 1997, jumping to ₹41.26 in 1998 (influenced by the Asian crisis and sanctions), ₹43.06 in 1999, and settling around ₹43.50-₹44.94 by 2000.
 * Economic Performance (1992-1997): Recovery and Growth
The post-reform period saw a marked recovery in economic performance. GDP growth, which had slumped during the crisis, picked up significantly, averaging over 7% annually between 1994/95 and 1996/97. The devaluation and trade reforms boosted exports, contributing to this recovery. Efforts towards fiscal consolidation were initiated, although bringing down the high deficits inherited from the 1980s remained a challenge; the central government deficit was around 5.5% of GDP in 1996. The Current Account Deficit narrowed considerably immediately after the crisis and remained at manageable levels through the mid-1990s, widening slightly to 1.5% of GDP in 1997/98 but well below the crisis levels. Inflation, after an initial spike following the devaluation, was generally contained. The opening up of the economy led to a gradual increase in both FDI and FII inflows. Crucially, foreign exchange reserves, which were the Achilles' heel in 1991, began a steady climb, reaching $25.2 billion by March 1995 and standing at $24 billion in July 1998, providing a much-needed buffer. The RBI's policy focused on managing the transition to the new exchange rate regime, intervening judiciously to prevent excessive volatility, accumulating reserves, and developing money market instruments (like repos, introduced in 1997) for liquidity management.
 * Navigating the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) (1997-1998): Relative Insulation
The resilience of the post-reform Indian economy was tested during the Asian Financial Crisis that began in mid-1997. Unlike several East Asian economies that suffered currency collapses, banking crises, and severe recessions, India weathered the storm relatively well. Several factors contributed to this relative insulation:
1.  Capital Account Management: India's capital account liberalization had been gradual and cautious, particularly concerning debt flows and short-term capital. This limited the build-up of volatile short-term external liabilities that proved disastrous elsewhere.
2.  Flexible Exchange Rate: The managed float system adopted in 1993 allowed the INR to adjust in an orderly fashion when pressures emerged, unlike the rigid pegs maintained by crisis-hit countries.
3.  Banking Sector: The Indian banking system had limited exposure to international markets and complex derivatives compared to banks in affected countries.
4.  Adequate Reserves: The reserves accumulated since 1991 provided the RBI with the capacity to intervene and manage market pressures.
The INR did come under pressure during the latter half of 1997 and early 1998 due to contagion effects and changing risk perceptions. The RBI responded by intervening in both spot and forward markets to supply dollars and manage liquidity, while also temporarily tightening monetary policy (raising interest rates) to discourage speculative outflows. Importantly, the RBI allowed the Rupee to depreciate, by about 18-19% against the US Dollar between July 1997 and July 1998, moving the rate towards the ₹41-42/$ level. This orderly depreciation acted as a shock absorber.
Economically, the AFC's impact was moderate. Export growth slowed due to reduced demand from the crisis-hit Asian region, but this was partly offset by lower global oil prices and the continued strength of India's emerging IT services exports. While portfolio investment (FII) inflows declined sharply, FDI and external commercial borrowing remained relatively stable. The CAD remained contained at around 1.5% of GDP. India's GDP growth did slow to 5% in 1997/98, but analysis suggests this was primarily due to domestic factors like a poor agricultural harvest and weaker investment demand that predated the main impact of the AFC.
The experience during the AFC demonstrated a significant increase in India's external sector resilience compared to the pre-1991 era. The policy shift towards a more flexible, market-oriented exchange rate (managed float), coupled with gradual capital account opening that prioritized stable flows (FDI) over volatile ones (short-term debt), and the crucial rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves, proved effective in insulating the economy from severe external contagion. This stood in stark contrast to the vulnerability exposed in 1991 and validated the direction of the reforms undertaken.
 * Late 1990s (1998-2000): Pokhran Sanctions and Continued Reforms
In May 1998, the newly formed BJP-led coalition government conducted a series of nuclear tests (Pokhran II). This triggered automatic sanctions under US law (Glenn Amendment), and several other countries also imposed restrictions. The sanctions included suspension of non-humanitarian aid, US opposition to loans from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) like the World Bank and IMF, termination of defence sales and certain technology transfers, and suspension of credit and guarantees from US agencies like the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).
However, the economic impact of these sanctions on India was assessed to be modest and relatively short-lived. Several factors contributed to this: the sanctions were not universally applied (e.g., by European nations), they were gradually eased by the US administration starting later in 1998, and crucially, the Indian government successfully launched the Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs) targeted mainly at the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) diaspora in August 1998. The RIBs raised over $4.2 billion, significantly bolstering foreign exchange reserves and shoring up market confidence at a critical juncture. This successful mobilization demonstrated India's reduced reliance on traditional aid and IFI channels susceptible to sanctions, and its improved ability to access global capital markets, including diaspora savings, a consequence of the post-1991 integration efforts.
During this period, economic growth continued at a moderate pace of 5-6%. Inflation saw a temporary spike in 1998, mainly due to adverse food price movements, but moderated subsequently. The fiscal deficit remained an area of concern. The USD/INR exchange rate continued its gradual depreciation path, moving from the post-AFC levels of ₹41-42/$ towards ₹43-45/$ by the year 2000. The RBI continued its policy of managed floating, intervening to curb volatility and further building up reserves, which crossed $38 billion by March 2000.
V. The Growth Phase (2000-2008): IT Boom, Capital Inflows, and RBI's Balancing Act
 * High Growth Era (2003-2008)
The period from 2003-04 to 2007-08 marked a phase of unprecedented economic expansion for India. Real GDP growth accelerated significantly, averaging nearly 9% per year during these five years. This robust performance propelled India into the league of the world's fastest-growing major economies. A key driver of this growth was the burgeoning services sector, particularly Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled Services (ITeS), which experienced a boom, leading to a surge in service exports. Manufacturing and construction sectors also registered strong double-digit growth during parts of this period. This high growth was underpinned by a significant acceleration in domestic investment and saving rates. Consequently, per capita income growth nearly doubled compared to the preceding decades, raising living standards and leading the Indian economy to cross the landmark $1 trillion mark (at market exchange rates) in 2007-08. Politically, this period largely coincided with the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA-I) government, which came to power in 2004, focusing on policies aimed at "inclusive growth".
 * Capital Inflows and INR Appreciation Pressure
This high-growth phase attracted massive capital inflows, particularly portfolio investments by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). Attracted by India's strong growth differential compared to advanced economies and positive market sentiment, FII inflows surged dramatically from 2003 onwards. While Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) also increased, portfolio flows were the dominant component during this period. Net capital inflows reached extraordinary levels, peaking at nearly 9.3% of GDP in 2007-08, with quarterly peaks potentially higher.
This deluge of foreign capital created immense appreciation pressure on the Indian Rupee. The USD/INR exchange rate, which hovered around ₹48/$ in 2002, began a significant appreciating trend. The Rupee strengthened considerably, breaching the ₹40/$ mark briefly in late 2007 and early 2008. The average exchange rate moved from around ₹45/$ in 2006 to ₹41/$ in 2007, before weakening slightly to average ₹43.5/$ in 2008 amidst the onset of the global financial crisis.
 * RBI Policy Response: Intervention and Sterilization
Faced with unprecedented capital inflows and the resultant upward pressure on the Rupee, the Reserve Bank of India intervened heavily and persistently in the foreign exchange market. The primary objective was to prevent excessive appreciation of the INR, which could have potentially harmed the competitiveness of India's exports, particularly the booming IT sector. The RBI became a large net purchaser of US Dollars in the market. This intervention led to a dramatic accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which surged from below $100 billion before 2004, crossing the $100 billion mark in 2004, $200 billion in late 2007, and eventually peaking near $310 billion in early 2008.
However, large-scale purchases of foreign currency inject an equivalent amount of Rupee liquidity into the domestic banking system. This excess liquidity posed a significant challenge for monetary management, potentially fueling inflation and asset price bubbles. To counteract this, the RBI undertook massive sterilization operations to absorb the excess Rupee liquidity. The primary tools used were Open Market Operations (OMO), involving the sale of government securities from the RBI's portfolio, and the innovative Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), introduced in April 2004. Under MSS, the government issued special treasury bills and bonds (MSS bonds), not to finance its deficit, but specifically to absorb the liquidity generated by RBI's forex purchases. The proceeds from MSS issuance were held in a separate account with the RBI. Studies suggest that RBI's sterilization efforts were substantial and largely effective in neutralizing the immediate liquidity impact, with estimates suggesting sterilization coefficients as high as 93% during parts of the period, although often incomplete. However, sterilization was not without costs (interest payments on MSS bonds) and complexities, including the "offset coefficient" – the tendency for sterilization efforts (which can keep domestic interest rates relatively high) to attract further capital inflows, partially offsetting the initial sterilization impact.
Simultaneously, the RBI also employed conventional monetary policy tools. As inflationary pressures began to build, particularly in 2006-2008, driven by strong domestic demand, rising global commodity prices (especially oil), and the liquidity overhang from capital inflows, the RBI tightened its monetary stance by raising the repo rate and the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) multiple times.
 * Fiscal Situation and Inflation
On the fiscal front, the government had enacted the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in 2003, which mandated a gradual reduction in fiscal and revenue deficits. Helped by buoyant tax revenues during the high-growth phase, some progress was made in fiscal consolidation, creating some buffer, although deficits remained above the mandated targets for parts of the period. Inflation, which was relatively benign in the initial years of the boom, started to accelerate from 2006 onwards. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation breached 6% in early 2007, eased temporarily, but surged again towards the end of 2007 and into 2008, driven significantly by the sharp rise in global crude oil and food prices, alongside strong domestic demand.

The period between 2003 and 2008 starkly illustrates the policy challenges encapsulated in the 'Impossible Trilemma'. As India embraced greater capital account openness, evidenced by the massive FII inflows, it faced a direct conflict between maintaining exchange rate stability and pursuing an independent monetary policy. The RBI's choice to heavily intervene in the forex market to prevent sharp Rupee appreciation demonstrated a clear preference for managing the exchange rate, likely to protect export competitiveness. However, this intervention directly impacted domestic liquidity, forcing the RBI into large-scale sterilization efforts (OMO and MSS) to prevent runaway inflation. These sterilization actions, while largely successful, had limitations and costs, and arguably constrained the independence of monetary policy, which also had to react to the inflationary pressures partly fueled by the inflows themselves. This episode highlights the inherent trade-offs faced by emerging markets navigating large capital flows.
Furthermore, the substantial build-up of foreign exchange reserves during this phase, though primarily a consequence of the policy response to appreciation pressures, inadvertently created a significant advantage. This large reserve cushion, exceeding $300 billion by early 2008, provided India with a crucial line of defence when the Global Financial Crisis erupted later that year. Unlike the 1991 crisis, where depleted reserves were a central cause of vulnerability, the ample reserves in 2008 allowed the RBI to manage the subsequent capital outflows and prevent a disorderly collapse of the currency, thereby mitigating the immediate financial shock of the GFC. This underscores the strategic importance of maintaining adequate reserve buffers, particularly for economies exposed to volatile capital flows.
VI. Global Shocks and Domestic Challenges (2008-2013): GFC, Inflation, and the Taper Tantrum
 * Impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC)
While India's domestic banking system was relatively insulated from the direct impact of the US subprime mortgage crisis due to limited integration and stricter regulations, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 marked the point at which the global crisis significantly impacted the Indian economy through second-round effects. The primary transmission channels were:
1.  Capital Outflows: The global flight to safety and deleveraging by international financial institutions led to a sharp reversal of the massive portfolio inflows (FII) that India had received in preceding years. FIIs became large net sellers in the Indian equity market to repatriate funds. Net capital inflows plummeted from 9.3% of GDP in 2007-08 to just 0.9% in 2008-09.
2.  Trade Channel: The deep recession in advanced economies caused a collapse in global demand, severely hitting India's exports, particularly merchandise exports, in the second half of 2008-09. Growth in software service exports also decelerated sharply.
3.  Exchange Rate: The sudden stop and reversal of capital flows exerted intense downward pressure on the INR. Having appreciated below ₹40/$ in early 2008, the Rupee depreciated sharply, crossing ₹50/$ by early 2009.
The combined impact of these shocks led to a significant slowdown in India's GDP growth, which fell from the 9%+ average of the preceding years to 6.7% in 2008-09.
 * Policy Response to GFC
The Indian authorities responded swiftly and aggressively to cushion the economy from the global downturn.
*   Monetary Policy: The RBI reversed its earlier tightening stance and undertook significant monetary easing. Policy rates (repo rate) were cut sharply and repeatedly, and the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was lowered substantially to inject liquidity into the banking system and encourage credit flow. The RBI also intervened in the forex market by selling dollars from its substantial reserves to meet outflow pressures and prevent a disorderly depreciation of the Rupee.
*   Fiscal Policy: The central government unveiled three major fiscal stimulus packages between December 2008 and February 2009. These packages included across-the-board excise duty cuts, increased plan expenditure, and support for specific sectors, aimed at boosting domestic demand to compensate for falling external demand. While necessary, this led to a significant deterioration in the fiscal deficit.
 * Post-GFC Recovery and Emerging Problems (2009-2012)
The coordinated and aggressive policy response resulted in a relatively quick V-shaped recovery. GDP growth bounced back strongly to 8.0% in 2009-10 and 8.6% in 2010-11, aided by the stimulus measures and a gradual recovery in the global economy. However, this recovery phase sowed the seeds for future problems.
The lingering effects of the large fiscal stimulus, combined with supply-side constraints (particularly in agriculture leading to high food inflation) and a rebound in global commodity prices, resulted in a prolonged period of high and persistent inflation from 2010 through 2012. Headline WPI inflation frequently hovered near double digits, and CPI inflation, which gives higher weight to food, became a major policy concern.
Simultaneously, the strong domestic demand recovery, fueled partly by the stimulus, led to a surge in imports, particularly oil and gold. Export growth, while recovering, could not keep pace. This resulted in a steady widening of the Current Account Deficit (CAD), which reached a record high of 4.2% of GDP in 2011-12 and remained elevated thereafter. Financing this large CAD required continuous capital inflows. The fiscal situation also remained stressed, with the post-GFC fiscal consolidation proving slower than anticipated, limiting the government's policy flexibility.
These growing macroeconomic imbalances – high inflation, a wide CAD, and a substantial fiscal deficit – made the Indian economy increasingly vulnerable to external shocks and shifts in investor sentiment. The INR came under renewed pressure from late 2011 onwards, partly due to these domestic concerns and partly due to global risk aversion linked to the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. The USD/INR rate depreciated significantly, moving from around ₹45/$ in mid-2011 to the ₹53-54/$ range by mid-2012. In response to the persistent high inflation, the RBI had shifted back to a monetary tightening cycle from early 2010, raising policy rates substantially over the next two years, despite the potential impact on slowing growth.
The policy choices made in response to the 2008 GFC highlight a difficult trade-off. The swift and substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus was effective in preventing a deeper and more prolonged recession, facilitating a rapid growth rebound. However, the scale of the stimulus and the pace of its withdrawal arguably contributed significantly to the subsequent overheating of the economy, manifesting as persistent high inflation and a structurally wider current account deficit. These imbalances, in turn, eroded the economy's resilience and left it exposed when global financial conditions tightened abruptly in 2013.
 * The 2013 Taper Tantrum
The vulnerability came to the fore in May 2013. Then-US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's remarks suggesting that the Fed might soon begin to taper (reduce) its massive Quantitative Easing (QE) bond purchase program triggered panic in global financial markets. Investors interpreted this as a signal of impending normalization of US monetary policy and higher US interest rates, leading to a sharp sell-off in global bonds and a flight of capital from emerging markets (EMs).
India was perceived as one of the most vulnerable EMs (dubbed one of the "Fragile Five") due to its 'twin deficits' (high CAD and fiscal deficit) and persistent high inflation. The country experienced massive capital outflows, particularly FIIs pulling money out of both debt and equity markets. This sudden stop in capital flows needed to finance the large CAD led to intense pressure on the INR. The currency depreciated sharply and rapidly, falling from around ₹55/$ in May 2013 to an all-time low of nearly ₹69/$ in August/September 2013. This sharp depreciation further fueled inflation by increasing the cost of imports, especially oil and essential commodities. The stock market experienced significant volatility, and borrowing costs rose.
The RBI and the government responded with a series of measures to stabilize the currency and restore confidence. The RBI raised short-term interest rates dramatically, tightened liquidity conditions, and introduced temporary capital control measures aimed at curbing outflows (e.g., restrictions on overseas investments by residents). Simultaneously, measures were taken to boost inflows, including a special swap window for oil marketing companies to access dollars directly from the RBI (reducing market demand) and a highly successful scheme offering concessional swap rates for banks raising FCNR(B) deposits and foreign currency borrowings. The government also took steps to compress non-essential imports, particularly gold. These measures eventually helped stabilize the Rupee and rebuild reserves, but the episode underscored India's vulnerability to shifts in global liquidity, especially when domestic fundamentals are weak.
The Taper Tantrum starkly illustrated the risks inherent in relying on potentially volatile portfolio flows to finance a large and persistent Current Account Deficit. When global sentiment shifted and these flows reversed abruptly, it triggered a currency crisis that forced policymakers into painful adjustments – namely, tightening monetary policy and restricting capital outflows – even as domestic economic growth was already slowing. This highlighted the need for structural reforms to reduce the CAD and attract more stable, long-term capital inflows like FDI.
VII. Navigating New Normals (2014-2019): Policy Shifts and Domestic Events
 * New Government and Policy Framework (2014 onwards)
May 2014 marked a significant political shift with the election of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, which secured a strong mandate. The new government emphasized economic reforms, improving the ease of doing business (with initiatives like "Make in India"), and maintaining macroeconomic stability, particularly fiscal consolidation.
A key development in the monetary policy sphere was the formal adoption of a flexible Inflation Targeting (IT) framework. Following recommendations from committees and public debate, the RBI Act was amended in 2015-16 to explicitly mandate price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy. A Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), comprising members from the RBI and government-appointed external experts, was established in 2016 to determine the policy repo rate. The target for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was set at 4%, with a tolerance band of +/- 2% (i.e., a range of 2% to 6%). This marked a move towards a more transparent, rule-based monetary policy regime.
 * Economic Performance and USD/INR (2014-2019)
The period from 2014 to 2019 saw a phase of relative macroeconomic stability compared to the tumultuous years preceding it. Economic growth was moderate initially after the Taper Tantrum recovery, picked up pace in the middle years, but began showing signs of a cyclical slowdown towards the end of 2018 and into 2019. Aided significantly by a period of lower global commodity prices (especially crude oil) and the credibility lent by the new IT framework, CPI inflation was gradually brought under control and largely remained within the mandated 2-6% tolerance band. The government maintained a focus on gradual fiscal consolidation, and fiscal deficit targets were broadly adhered to, although pressures remained, particularly regarding the quality of expenditure and off-budget liabilities. The Current Account Deficit narrowed considerably from the highs seen during 2011-13, benefiting from lower oil import bills and government measures to curb gold imports, remaining at generally manageable levels.
Reflecting this improved macroeconomic stability, the USD/INR exchange rate exhibited significantly less volatility compared to 2011-2013. The Rupee traded in a relatively contained range, depreciating gradually over the period. It moved from the ₹60-63/$ levels seen in 2014-15 towards the ₹70-72/$ range by late 2018 and 2019. The RBI continued its policy of managed floating, intervening in the forex market primarily to smooth excessive volatility rather than targeting a specific level, and used periods of inflow to steadily build up foreign exchange reserves, which crossed the $400 billion mark during this period.
The establishment of the formal Inflation Targeting framework in 2016 represented a landmark change in India's monetary policy architecture. By explicitly prioritizing CPI inflation within a defined band and setting up the MPC for transparent decision-making, the framework aimed to anchor inflation expectations more effectively and enhance the credibility of monetary policy. While the RBI continued to intervene in the foreign exchange market to manage volatility, the primacy accorded to the inflation target likely provided a clearer anchor for policy actions during this period, contributing, alongside favorable factors like lower oil prices, to the moderation of inflation observed.
 * Major Domestic Events
This period also witnessed significant domestic policy initiatives and events that impacted the economy:
*   Demonetization (November 2016): The government announced the withdrawal of legal tender status for existing ₹500 and ₹1000 denomination banknotes, accounting for approximately 86% of the currency in circulation. The stated objectives were to combat counterfeit currency, curb illicit wealth ('black money'), disrupt terror financing, and promote a shift towards digital payments. The move caused significant short-term disruption, particularly for cash-reliant sectors like agriculture and the vast informal economy, leading to a temporary slowdown in GDP growth. There was immediate volatility in the INR following the announcement. While digital transactions saw a boost, the long-term success in achieving the primary objectives remains a subject of ongoing debate.
*   Goods and Services Tax (GST) (July 2017): This was arguably the most significant indirect tax reform in India's history, subsuming multiple central and state taxes (like excise duty, service tax, VAT, octroi) into a single, unified tax structure. The aim was to create a common national market, simplify the tax system, reduce cascading effects, improve compliance, and potentially boost long-term economic efficiency and growth. The transition involved initial implementation challenges for businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, adjustments in supply chains, and some temporary effects on inflation and economic activity.
*   IL&FS Crisis (2018): A series of defaults starting in September 2018 by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), a large, systemically important Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) with a complex group structure and significant debt, triggered a severe liquidity crisis within the broader NBFC sector. IL&FS had funded long-term infrastructure assets with shorter-term borrowings, creating asset-liability mismatches. The defaults led to a freeze in the commercial paper market and a sharp increase in borrowing costs for other NBFCs, which had become significant providers of credit, especially to sectors underserved by banks. This credit crunch impacted sectors like real estate and auto, raising concerns about financial stability and contributing to the economic slowdown observed in late 2018 and 2019. The government intervened by superseding the IL&FS board and initiating a resolution process.
These major domestic events, while distinct in their nature and objectives, introduced significant complexities into the macroeconomic environment during this period. Demonetization and GST implementation, aimed at structural reforms, caused considerable short-term friction and uncertainty, impacting growth, liquidity, and potentially inflation dynamics. The IL&FS crisis highlighted vulnerabilities within the financial sector, impacting credit flow and sentiment. These domestic shocks interacted with global factors and underlying economic trends, influencing overall performance, investor sentiment, capital flows, and consequently, the exchange rate during their respective implementation and fallout phases.
VIII. Recent Years and Outlook (2020-2025): Pandemic, Recovery, and Future Path
 * Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2022)
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 delivered an unprecedented shock to the global and Indian economies. Nationwide lockdowns imposed to contain the virus spread led to a severe contraction in economic activity. India's real GDP shrank by 5.8% in the fiscal year 2020-21 (FY21). The impact was particularly harsh on contact-intensive services and the informal sector, leading to widespread job losses and hardship.
The pandemic triggered significant volatility in financial markets. As global risk aversion spiked in March-April 2020, India witnessed capital outflows, and the INR depreciated sharply, falling from around ₹71/$ to near ₹77/$. However, the policy response was swift and substantial. The government announced large fiscal support packages (summarized under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative) involving credit guarantees, support for vulnerable sections, and liquidity measures. The RBI slashed policy rates to historic lows, ensured ample liquidity in the banking system, and provided regulatory forbearance, including a loan moratorium.
Following the initial shock, the economy began a gradual recovery, aided by policy support, adaptation to the pandemic, and progress on vaccination. GDP growth rebounded sharply by 9.7% in FY22 and 7.0% in FY23. Capital flows also saw volatility, with strong inflows resuming later in 2020 and 2021, particularly into the equity market, buoyed by massive global liquidity injections by central banks worldwide. The RBI likely intervened significantly during periods of inflow, leading to foreign exchange reserves accumulating rapidly and reaching an all-time high of over 642 billion in late 2021. This intervention helped stabilize the INR, which traded largely in the ₹73-76/ range during much of 2020 and 2021. The Current Account Deficit remained low and even turned into a small surplus temporarily in FY21 due to sharp import compression during the lockdowns, before widening again as the economy recovered.
 * Post-Pandemic Recovery and Global Headwinds (2022-2024)
India's economic recovery continued into 2022, but faced new headwinds from the global environment. The Russia-Ukraine war, starting in February 2022, caused a surge in global commodity prices, particularly for crude oil, natural gas, food items, and fertilizers, impacting India significantly as a major importer. This exacerbated global inflationary pressures that were already building due to pandemic-related supply disruptions and strong demand recovery. In response, central banks across the world, led by the US Federal Reserve, embarked on aggressive monetary tightening cycles, raising interest rates sharply throughout 2022 and 2023.
These global developments impacted India significantly. Inflation, which had remained relatively contained, spiked sharply in 2022, breaching the upper tolerance limit of the RBI's target range (6%) for several months. The RBI responded by reversing its accommodative stance, initiating a cycle of policy rate hikes starting in May 2022 and withdrawing excess liquidity. The aggressive tightening by the Fed led to a strengthening of the US Dollar globally and triggered capital outflows from many emerging markets, including India. Combined with the higher import bill due to elevated commodity prices, this put renewed pressure on the INR. The currency depreciated past the psychological ₹80/$ mark in mid-2022 and traded largely in a range of ₹81-83/$ through much of 2023 and early 2024. The RBI continued to intervene actively in the forex market to manage this volatility and prevent excessive depreciation, utilizing its large reserve buffer, which saw some drawdown from the peaks but remained robust. Some analysis suggests RBI's intervention intensified during 2023, leading to unusually low volatility in the INR/USD pair.
Despite these headwinds, the Indian economy displayed remarkable resilience, remaining the fastest-growing major economy in the world. Growth was estimated at a strong 8.2% for FY24. Inflation gradually moderated through 2023 and early 2024, moving back towards the RBI's tolerance band. The fiscal consolidation path resumed after the pandemic-related spike in deficits. The CAD widened significantly in FY23 due to high commodity prices but narrowed substantially in FY24, aided by softening oil prices, resilient service exports, and healthy remittances.
The experience through the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global shocks highlighted the benefits of the macroeconomic buffers built over the preceding years. The substantial foreign exchange reserves accumulated allowed the RBI to manage exchange rate volatility effectively without triggering a crisis, despite significant global turmoil and capital flow reversals. The inflation targeting framework provided a credible anchor for monetary policy, guiding the response to the inflation surge in 2022. This resilience, compared to previous episodes of external stress, underscores the progress made in strengthening India's macroeconomic fundamentals.
 * Current Situation and Outlook (2024-2025)
As of mid-2025, the Indian economy continues to exhibit strong growth momentum. The IMF, in its April 2025 World Economic Outlook, projects India's real GDP to grow by 6.2% in 2025 (corresponding largely to FY26) and 6.3% in 2026 (FY27), maintaining its position as the world's fastest-growing large economy. This outlook is supported by expectations of robust domestic demand, continued government focus on capital expenditure, healthy corporate and bank balance sheets enabling credit growth, and the potential benefits of ongoing structural reforms, including digitalization. However, risks remain, primarily stemming from the uncertain global environment, including geopolitical tensions, potential volatility in commodity prices (especially oil), the possibility of a sharper-than-expected global slowdown impacting exports, and domestic factors like the strength of private consumption recovery.
Inflation is expected to continue its convergence towards the RBI's 4% target, assuming moderation in food price volatility. This trajectory could provide space for the RBI to consider gradual monetary policy easing later in the forecast horizon, although the MPC is expected to remain data-dependent and focused on anchoring inflation expectations. The fiscal consolidation roadmap is expected to continue, aiming to reduce the general government deficit and debt levels gradually. The Current Account Deficit is projected to remain moderate and comfortably financeable, likely staying around 1.3% of GDP in FY26.
The outlook for the USD/INR exchange rate suggests relative stability compared to the sharp depreciations seen in some prior periods, although modest depreciation pressures may persist. As of May 2025, the rate is trading around ₹84.5 - ₹85.6 per USD. Forecasts from analysts and models generally point towards the rate remaining in the mid-80s range over the next year, with Trading Economics estimating levels around 85.66 by end-quarter and 86.35 in 12 months. The key determinants will be the interplay of India's growth performance relative to the US and other major economies, inflation differentials, the direction and volume of capital flows (influenced by global interest rate paths and risk sentiment), trends in global oil prices, and the RBI's intervention strategy. The RBI is widely expected to continue its policy of intervening to curb excessive volatility rather than defending any specific level, while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to fundamental factors over time.
However, the observation of intensified exchange rate management in 2023-24 raises pertinent questions about the de facto operation of the IT framework. While the framework formally prioritizes inflation, the RBI's actions suggest a significant weight continues to be placed on exchange rate stability. This could be driven by concerns about imported inflation via a weaker Rupee, the need to maintain export competitiveness, or managing the financial stability implications of sharp currency movements given India's integration with global capital markets. This apparent dual focus highlights the ongoing practical challenges of applying a pure IT framework in a large, complex emerging market subject to substantial capital flow volatility, suggesting a continued adherence to a managed float regime where exchange rate considerations remain highly relevant for policy decisions, potentially complicating the strict adherence to the Impossible Trilemma doctrine.

IX. Conclusion
 * Summary of Key Drivers
The trajectory of the USD/INR exchange rate over the past seven and a half decades has been a complex narrative shaped by the interplay of India's evolving economic structure, domestic policy choices, and global economic forces. From the initial stability under the Bretton Woods fixed peg, punctuated by the 1949 devaluation linked to Sterling, the journey saw a major rupture with the 1966 devaluation, forced by accumulated internal imbalances (fiscal and trade deficits) and external shocks (wars, aid cut-off). The subsequent shift to a basket peg provided more flexibility but proved insufficient to prevent the 1991 BoP crisis, driven by unsustainable fiscal policies, rising external debt, and the Gulf War shock.
The post-1991 liberalization era marked a fundamental shift. The move to a market-determined (managed float) exchange rate, coupled with trade and investment liberalization, increased India's integration with the global economy. This era saw periods of rapid growth fueled by reforms and strong capital inflows (especially 2003-2008), leading to significant INR appreciation pressures managed by heavy RBI intervention and sterilization. Global crises – the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-98), the Global Financial Crisis (2008-09), the Taper Tantrum (2013), and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-21) – each tested India's resilience, eliciting varied policy responses and impacting the INR through capital flow reversals, trade disruptions, and shifts in risk sentiment. Domestic policies, including the pursuit of fiscal consolidation (FRBM Act), the adoption of Inflation Targeting, and major structural reforms like GST, alongside disruptive events like Demonetization and the IL&FS crisis, have also significantly influenced the macroeconomic environment and, consequently, the exchange rate dynamics. Throughout this journey, the Reserve Bank of India has played a crucial role, evolving its policy framework from maintaining fixed pegs to managing volatility under a float, accumulating substantial foreign exchange reserves, and balancing the often-conflicting objectives of price stability, growth, and external stability.
 * Evolution of India's External Sector
India's external sector has transformed dramatically since 1947. Initially a relatively closed economy operating under stringent controls (FERA) and reliant on foreign aid to cover chronic BoP deficits, it faced severe crises when underlying imbalances became unsustainable or external support faltered (1966, 1991). The 1991 reforms initiated a process of gradual opening up. Trade liberalization boosted exports, while the cautious opening of the capital account attracted significant FDI and FII inflows, albeit also increasing exposure to global financial cycles. The Current Account Deficit, while fluctuating, has generally been financed by capital inflows rather than aid in the post-reform era. A defining feature of this evolution has been the massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, particularly since the early 2000s, transforming India from a reserve-scarce nation to one holding some of the largest reserves globally. This reserve buffer has proven critical in enhancing resilience to external shocks, as demonstrated during the GFC, Taper Tantrum, and COVID-19 pandemic, allowing the RBI to manage volatility without precipitating a full-blown crisis. However, managing large and volatile capital flows within the constraints of the Impossible Trilemma remains an ongoing policy challenge.
 * Concluding Thoughts
The history of the USD/INR exchange rate underscores the intricate relationship between a nation's currency value, its domestic policy choices, its structural economic characteristics, and the volatile global environment. The long-term trend has been one of depreciation, reflecting factors such as historical inflation differentials, productivity gaps, and periods of significant macroeconomic stress. However, the pace and volatility of this depreciation have been heavily influenced by the prevailing exchange rate regime, the stance of fiscal and monetary policies, the magnitude and composition of capital flows, and the economy's resilience to shocks.
The journey from fixed pegs to a managed float and the adoption of inflation targeting represent significant strides towards a more mature and resilient macroeconomic framework. Yet, the balancing act for policymakers remains complex. Pursuing high growth requires investment and imports, potentially pressuring the current account. Maintaining price stability under the IT framework requires careful monetary management, which can be complicated by large capital flows influencing liquidity and the exchange rate. Managing the exchange rate to curb volatility or maintain competitiveness can, in turn, constrain monetary policy independence.
Looking ahead (2025 and beyond), India's robust growth outlook relative to global peers, coupled with moderating inflation and a manageable current account deficit, suggests a basis for relative INR stability. However, vulnerability to global factors – particularly shifts in global risk appetite affecting capital flows, geopolitical events impacting commodity prices (especially oil), and the trajectory of monetary policy in advanced economies – persists. Continued focus on strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals through prudent fiscal management, effective inflation control under the IT framework, attracting stable long-term capital inflows (FDI), and further structural reforms to enhance productivity and export competitiveness will be crucial for ensuring long-term currency stability and sustained economic growth. The RBI's approach to managing the exchange rate will continue to be closely watched, navigating the fine line between curbing excessive volatility and allowing the currency to adjust to underlying economic forces.
